<hr class="d4" />

<p>The publication of this volume was suggested by the astonishing ignorance
displayed and the antiquated ideas entertained upon questions
of health and disease by most persons with whom I came in professional
contact, even by those who were accomplished in other subjects of a
scholastic and scientific nature. The practical importance of the subject
naturally led me to the consideration of diseases that are essentially inflammatory,
for over seventy-five per cent of all diseases of women are of
an inflammatory nature. In this respect the book differs from other
works on similar subjects.</p>

<p>In discussing this class of diseases I have aimed to present a treatise
simple in style, and easily understood by the casual reader. While I
have endeavored to impart strictly scientific information, I have tried to
impart it in familiar language, avoiding the use of technical terms as far
as possible, and carefully defining them when their use became indispensable.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE REASON WHY.</p>

<p>I see a large field of usefulness which has not been covered
by competent authorities. I propose, therefore, to offer
a plain, simple statement of the most common causes of
physical suffering in women, and a simple and reliable
method of home or domestic treatment, to be carried out
by the patients themselves, which, in the great majority of
cases, is easily applied.</p>

<p>The first nine years of my professional life was an untiring
and incessant devotion to the arduous demands of a
large family practice, after which I decided to go to Europe,
and there prosecute such studies in two German universities
as my experience as a practitioner had fully convinced
me to be of the greatest practical and scientific importance;
hence, I offer no excuse or apology for aught I may say on
a subject with which I have taken especial pains to familiarize
myself. Having in a measure established my identity,
I am more fully prepared to proceed in a more congenial
way.</p>

<p>In the realm of thought there is no monopoly, and it is,
after all, at the bar of public opinion that a final judgment
must decide the merits of my course.</p>

<p>The question is not what to teach, but whom to teach.
This may seem, at first sight, an easy matter to determine,
but a more careful inquiry will show the complexity.</p>

<p>The platform of a medical college is considered by some
the only legitimate place from which a medical man may
impart his knowledge, but here the opportunity is limited,
notwithstanding the abnormally great number of these
institutions. This, however, is not the only reason. Medical
colleges are becoming so numerous, that they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
be discouraged by all honest and high-minded medical
men, because in this country they are private institutions,
with very few exceptions, and subserve sinister purposes, in
furthering the interests of their promoters either as advertising
schemes or money-making institutions, or both.</p>

<p>Of course they are incorporated under State laws, which
make them <i>quasi</i>-public institutions, but the State exercises
no authority over them, and their self-constituted professors
conduct them to suit their own private ends. They are
not limited by law, nor is a <i>required course</i> for their students
imperative, so that the public have no guarantee of
the fitness or competency of their graduates. There is, also,
an unhealthy rivalry among our colleges for students, improper
material is taken in, and correspondingly poor
material is turned out; this in turn causes a rivalry among
their graduates in making spoil of the sick.</p>

<p>Every self-respecting and competent medical man has
an utter contempt for these doctor mills. This will never
be different in this country until we follow the plan of
European governments, and make medical colleges State
institutions, and their professors officers of the State, with
liberal salaries.</p>

<p>The medical press has a comparatively limited opportunity
for imparting information to the public, unless the
editor of the secular press happens to make a quotation.</p>

<p>The exclusiveness that has characterized the learned
professions generally, and the medical profession particularly,
is rapidly passing away. Only half a century ago, the
medical lectures in Germany were mostly delivered in the
Latin language, and, while we now often suffer, in listening
to medical lectures in <i>bad</i> English, the latter may still be
the lesser evil. In fact, so great is the deference to public
opinion in favor of diffusing knowledge that medical faculties
court popular favor by delivering a course of lectures
on medical subjects, and consider these the best-drawing
card of the institution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Information that is not sensational nor untruthful cannot
fail to do incalculable good to the class for whom it is
intended, namely, our wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters,
so that they may avoid errors, that entail suffering and disease;
information that will teach them how to cure themselves
of the commoner and simpler ailments, and thus
avoid running to the doctor, who cannot always afford to
tell them the truth. Some would not if they could.</p>

<p>The Darwinian theory is of wider application than to
mere animal or plant life; it extends itself to the overcrowded
professions, and the increasing “struggle for existence”
in the ranks of the profession makes men dishonest
and greedy for any opportunity to raise a fee, so that patients
are being treated for diseases which are created for them
by the cunning and dishonesty of their doctors.</p>

<p>A little common sense and a knowledge of the elementary
principles of disease would be the best protection against
these deceptions; but, as a rule, sick persons are inclined to
throw aside all good sense, and give themselves up entirely
to their feelings or to their doctor. This is a very wrong
thing to do, and opens the door for all manner of impositions.</p>

<p>The general practitioner of thoughtful and studious
habits finds that, in the course of years, a diversified reading
on the different diseases which in the routine of his
work he is called upon to treat makes him a generally well-informed
man, but not a thoroughly exact man, either in
theory or in the details of his treatment.</p>

<p>Fifty to sixty years ago the entire field of medicine was
comparatively so small that it was easier for a brilliant
mind then, to comprehend all that was believed to be known,
than it is for the same quality of mind to understand any
of the subdivisions of medicine to-day.</p>

<p>Those were the days of doctrines and rules. Little that
was absolutely correct or true was then known about disease,
otherwise such absurd theories as the “<i>dynamization</i> or
<i>spirit-like</i>” influence, causing disease on the one hand, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that the “great source” of chronic diseases was <i>psora</i>, or
itch, on the other, as Hahnemann would have them believe,
could never have gotten a foothold.</p>

<p>These are the days of scientific deductions from microscopical
and physiological research, in laboratories connected
with great universities, and the result is, that any of
the specialties or subdivisions of medicine is as large and
interesting a field as the entire area was some time ago.
It thus happens, that some thoughtful persons, after years
of general practice, drift almost involuntarily into some
one department of medical art and science. To this they
become gradually wedded, and in it they grow in knowledge
and experience far beyond their previous anticipations.
What they read on the subject is better understood, and new
ideas are constantly formed, which enlarge the scope of their
knowledge. In this manner the writer drifted into the
domain of diseases peculiar to women, which was as unhappy
on the one hand, as it is interesting on the other, for
the phrase “<i>diseases of women</i>” has fallen into disrepute
because every superficial practitioner professes to know all
about them, and it often is but another name for criminal
abortion.</p>

<p>But for all that, there is a legitimate and scientific specialty
of women’s diseases. The time-serving specialist must
be exposed in every department of medical science. Whether
the pretender is labeled, a professor in a college, or labels
himself through glaring newspaper advertisements, one is
just as much a catch-penny as the other.</p>

<p>The object of educating the laity cannot be reasonably
confined to a few medical truths, but the perversion of the
truth must also be understood, so that the false can be detected.
It is necessary to point out the dangers and frauds
which are the unhealthy outgrowths or excrescences of
established truths, and there must be no veneering of the
wicked and sinful with ambiguous phrases to shield the
guilty; the truthful and innocent require no apologist.</p>

<p>The honest observer can pursue no middle way in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
work to which he has devoted the best years of a studious
life, and hence he may seem radical in his opinions. While
policy often dictates a conservative course, that which conscience
and reason dictate to be true is prompted by loftier
motives, namely, to subserve the highest purpose of moral
integrity.</p>

<p>It has often been said that this is a mechanical age.
How true is this even in the furtherance of science! How
true is this of the science of astronomy, which was revolutionized
by the construction of good telescopes! Mechanical
genius has perfected a lens for Mount Hamilton thirty-six
inches in diameter, and one is now in course of construction
for Mount Wilson, in Southern California, which is to
measure forty inches. Through these means scientists hope
to decipher the complexion of remote planets.</p>

<p>Microscopic lenses have been equally perfected, and, by
means of achromatic condensers and immersion lenses,
great magnifying power can be obtained with perfect distinctness.
That this mechanical spirit of the age should
also have obtained a foothold in medical art and science,
is but natural. Surgical and other mechanical methods
have entered so boldly into the field of diseases of women
that the writer feels constrained to sound a note of alarm.
Great strides have been made in a more perfected technique
in abdominal operations, and, by favorable recoveries from
grave and severe operations, the field of surgical usefulness
became enlarged, but this has degenerated into a license
for notoriety and personal aggrandizement of not over-scrupulous
and selfish surgeons who are over-anxious to
operate so as to be able to boast of the great number of
their capital operations, or laparotomies.</p>

<p>I was enthusiastic in abdominal and pelvic surgery, but
not until I entered the field as a specialist in this department
of medicine did I see and hear of daily abuses and
misuses of this branch of surgery. In many instances it
degenerated into criminal malpractice. It will be instructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
information to cite a few cases which occurred under
my observation, and present the actual facts to the reader.</p>

<p>It was in the month of February, in the year 1888, that
a business trip to the southern part of the State forced an
absence of several weeks upon me. Some two months before
this time I had been called to see a young woman, who had
then been sick for several months. She informed me that
she had been married nine years, and, not having had any
children, she concluded to see a noted specialist of female
diseases. By this physician she was told that her sterility
was owing to a closure or contraction of the mouth of the
womb. This was obviously a wrong diagnosis, and for
these reasons: she had always menstruated regularly and
without pain, which excludes a constriction; and, secondly,
no physician can honestly call a woman sterile until he
has examined her husband, who, in the majority of instances,
is the cause of his wife’s sterility, because it is he
who is sterile. This woman and the doctor agreed, however,
on a course of treatment, which was to forcibly open
or stretch the mouth and cervical canal of the womb. This
by itself is neither a dangerous nor a severe operation, if
carefully performed, but care in this case was evidently not
exercised, because the young woman was taken with severe
inflammation, which caused a pelvic abscess.</p>

<p>I found her after two months of suffering. The discharge
had become extremely offensive, her body emaciated,
and her strength exhausted.</p>

<p>I enlarged the opening of the abscess, placed a large
drainage tube in the cavity, through which it was washed out,
by means of an antiseptic solution of bichloride of mercury,
1 part to 2,000 parts of water, and, by further giving her
simple, nutritious food, she improved rapidly, so that the
day before I left the city she was at my office, and told me
that she felt as well as ever, although not thoroughly recovered.
I was absent two weeks, and a few days after my
return I incidentally met her husband, who told me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a week after I had left, his wife felt unwell and called in
one of her former doctors, who, by the way, rides a hobbyhorse
on surgery. This man found a few pimples on her
body, which can be found on almost any healthy person,
these, he said, were signs of blood poisoning from her abscess,
and that an operation to extirpate the abscess, with
one or both of her ovaries, was of urgent necessity to save
her life from blood poisoning. The deceived woman was
of course frightened into giving her consent to the operation,
which was undertaken immediately, and, as luck would
have it, she recovered; but she might have easily died,
which she undoubtedly would have done had this <i>knife-man</i>
got her sooner, or before I had restored to her a splendid
physical condition, which withstood the unnecessary butchery
to which she was induced to submit.</p>

<p>Some doctors seem to have a perfect mania for cutting
operations, just as though the entire science and art of
medicine were exhausted in surgery alone. To assume this
for an instant is manifestly ridiculous. More lives are annually
saved by a scientific application of other methods
of cure than the most elaborate and brilliant statistics of
surgery can approach. There is science and skill in selecting
proper medicines, in the employment of hygiene or the
rules of health, in the practice of obstetrics, and in a variety
of other ways to demonstrate the triumphs of the art of
healing.</p>

<p>The rash and unnecessary resort to the knife has brought
surgery into general distrust, so that some patients would
rather die, or wait until they are almost dead, before they
allow an operation to be performed on them, in cases where
surgery is, indeed, the only possible method of cure.</p>

<p>A lady recently called at my office for a consultation.
I found her uterus and other pelvic organs in a perfectly
healthy condition, although she suffered pain there. This
was due to neuralgia from a generally exhausted and debilitated
condition. I was not a little surprised to learn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
from her own lips, that she had been treated for womb
disease, and was about to undergo an operation for a tear in
the mouth of her womb. This was manifestly absurd, because
no laceration existed at all, and if there had it might
not have been necessary, because it is quite natural for
women who have borne children to have the scars of old
lacerations on the mouths of their wombs, and they are not
any the worse for them.</p>

<p>It is important for mothers to know something about
themselves and of the common diseases to which they are
liable, for then they will not be so easily persuaded to permit
the use of caustics, or the cutting, stitching, or scraping
of their wombs, which is quite likely to excite complicated
inflammations, more serious in their results than the diseases
for which these operations were performed. I know of what
I write, and there is no one who can successfully deny it.</p>

<p>Dr. William Goodell, who stands as high in the department
of diseases of women as any American, had an article
in one of the medical journals on “The Abuses of Uterine
Treatment.” He says: “From a large experience I humbly
offer to the reader the following watchwords as broad helps
to diagnosis: 1. Always bear in mind what another has
pithily said, that ‘woman has some organs outside of the
pelvis.’ 2. Each neurotic case will usually have a tale of
fret or grief, of cark and care, of wear and tear. 3. Scant
or delayed or suppressed menstruation is far more frequently
the result of nerve exhaustion than of uterine disease. 4.
Anteflexion of the womb, <i>per se</i>, is not a pathological condition.
It is so when associated with sterility or painful
menstruation, and only then does it need treatment. 5.
An irritable bladder is more a nerve symptom than a uterine
one. 6. In a large number of cases of supposed or actual
uterine disease, which display marked gastric disturbance, if
the tongue be clean the essential disease will be found to be
neurotic, and it must be treated so. 7. Almost every supposed
uterine case, characterized by excess of sensibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and by lack of will-power, is essentially a neurosis. 8. In
the vast majority of cases in which the woman takes to her
bed, and stays there indefinitely, from some supposed uterine
lesion, she is bedridden from her brain and not from her
womb. I will go further, and assert that this will be the
rule even when the womb is displaced, or it is disordered
by a lesion or disease, that is not in itself exacting or
dangerous to life. Finally, uterine or womb symptoms are
not <i>always</i> present in cases of uterine disease, nor, when
present and even urgent, do they necessarily come from
uterine disease, for they may be merely nerve counterfeits
of uterine disease.”</p>

<p>There is not a physician of any extended experience
in the land who, if he be true to his better judgment, will
not indorse every word of Professor Goodell’s propositions.
But the chances are they will never accomplish the good
for which they were intended if the mothers, wives, and
daughters are not permitted “a little peep” behind the
curtain, and learn for themselves. For those who are
wealthy and have plenty of money, doctoring may be a
luxury or an amusement, but there the line must be drawn
for the benefit of the deserving poor, with whom any treatment
is a hardship. Stupidity of the masses is one of the
causes of the abuse of surgical treatments, for they always
look upon a surgical or bloody operation as one of the
greatest achievements of modern medical art. Then there
is the cupidity of the professional classes, who trade upon
this popular error and delusion, and charge correspondingly
large fees, which, as a rule, are exorbitant, particularly
when the working classes are the sufferers.</p>

<p>A little cutting or stitching is much more quickly done,
and the patient may be dismissed as cured, or left under
the impression “that everything was done that could have
been done,” than a conservative medical or hygienic treatment,
which involves more thought, labor, and patience,
qualities which are not as eagerly cultivated as the art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to wring out a good fee by a little surgery, with less labor
and skill.</p>

<p>There is not only too much mischievous doctoring, but
there is too much of every kind, whether good, bad, or indifferent.
The trouble is there are too many in the ranks
of the medical profession; and this is not only true of this
country, but is raising a cry of warning in Europe. The
struggle for existence is a natural law, and nature is immutable.
I do not mean to say, that it is a humane law, or
that competition is a virtue; in fact, I believe quite the
reverse. But much that is natural from a physical standpoint
might not be so from a moral or spiritual plane; thus
the two natures are distinct.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to suppose that, if the natural crop of
diseases falls short of supplying the demands of those who
hunger for an opportunity to treat disease, and it lies
within their power to create disease, they will certainly
do so. The deficiency must be supplied, or one of two
things must be done by the doctor: he must either starve,
or go to work at something else. This may be cruel logic,
but I know that these are the actual facts.</p>

<p>Now let me ask how many persons who have some sort
of a diploma will be self-sacrificing enough or sufficiently
unselfish to prefer to starve or honestly work for a living,
if they can avoid either, by defrauding someone out of a fee,
for pretending to cure some manufactured disease? It seems
almost a waste of time to argue such a self-evident proposition.
I have known physicians of high standing who treated
women for womb diseases which never had a real existence,
and surgeons of large incomes to remove the female breast
for a “supposed cancer;” and, that being the case, what
would you expect from a less fortunate brother practitioner
who is eking out a miserable existence?</p>

<p>How many a case of simple sore throat or tonsilitis is
being paraded as a case of diphtheria. Why, I know of
doctors who built up their reputations in that way. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
quite an easy matter, to call an ordinary, simple case of
bronchitis, pneumonia. Harmless swellings, no matter
of what sort, are treated and palmed off every day as
cancers. The quack cancer doctor is almost ubiquitous.
Some would much rather part with the village parson, or
their regular old town doctor, than to part with the cancer
doctor. Diseases that are conjured up in the minds of susceptible
or hypochondriac persons have for them a real
existence, because if a person believes he has a certain disease,
it becomes a reality, as far as his own state of mind
is concerned, and as far as the treatment is concerned to
him who created the delusion, it is much more desirable
than if the disease were real, because you can cure an imaginary
disease, which may be impossible when a real one
comes under treatment. This is another method of making a
reputation for extraordinary cures that really never occurred.</p>

<p>When I contemplated writing a book, which I hoped
to make a <i>vade mecum</i> for those who felt interested in the
subject, I felt that it would be a duty which I should reluctantly
perform, for it would be a criticism on the status of
the medical profession of this country. I was convinced
that whatever I said that would lower the tone of the profession
in the estimation of my countrymen would naturally
reflect on me as unfavorably as upon any other member,
for I never claimed to be anything else but an American
physician, and, as such, I have an ambition to elevate the
rank and file to honor and respectability.</p>

<p>There is also a motive that underlies a work of this
nature which should appear justifiable to the author. It
is absolutely necessary that side-lights should be thrown
into dark corners and recesses that are usually screened from
public notice. If there is a growing deterioration in methods
of proficiency and morals, the public should know it, for
who is the greater villain, he who trifles with human life
through officious ignorance and venturous operations, or the
midnight assassin, who, under cover of darkness, waylays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
his unwary victim? The title “doctor,” from the Latin
<i>doceo</i>, “I teach,” has a halo of learning that it derives from
the original significance that was attached to it when it was
first sanctioned at Bologna University, about the middle of
the twelfth century, where it first passed into the faculty of
divinity. It was afterwards introduced into the universities
of Northern Europe, and remained ever since a degree of
distinction in theology, law, philosophy, and medicine. In
the German universities <i>doctor</i> implies also a license to teach
within the university, as a <i>privat-docent</i>.</p>

<p>When we now consider that no person can matriculate
in a German university who has not graduated from the
gymnasium or high school, it is clear that, under the above
conditions, the title “doctor” guarantees that the possessor
is an educated person, not only of the high school, but added
thereto is the accomplishment in the specialty of which he
holds the doctor degree.</p>

<p>What may a “doctor degree” mean in this country?
The title of an illiterate and utterly incompetent person,
who was by natural environment and occupation a teamster,
saloon keeper, barber, tailor, or patent-medicine vender, etc.</p>

<p>If a woman, she may be retraced to an ignorant nurse,
midwife, or quacksalver, the conceited wife of a man who
indulges her in the freak of “learning to be a doctor,” for
she had demonstrated her genius for the profession by successfully
treating a case of measles, which started the doctor’s
bee a-buzzing in her bonnet, until she passed through
a medical college; last, but not least, are the winsome
daughters of the millionaire or successful business man,
who imagine themselves too smart to make useful housewives
and good mothers.</p>

<p>There is not a medical college in this State, and there are
few, if any, in the United States, that would not eagerly
take in all of this material, and guarantee to them beforehand,
that they can graduate as <i>medicinæ doctor</i> in twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
months to three years, a five months’ course being considered
a year.</p>

<p>The above comparison is a disgraceful commentary on
the degree of <i>doctor</i> in this country, and the public should
learn to know the difference.</p>

<p>“The United States and Its Doctors” is the title of an
editorial in the July number of the New York <i>Medical
Record</i>, and it says: “There is certainly no more curious
social phenomenon than that of the extraordinary popularity
of the medical profession in this country as a means
of securing a livelihood.</p>

<p>“This subject is one that is often dwelt upon, but we
doubt if many even yet realize the grotesque misproportion
which medicine in the United States holds to other bread-winning
occupations. Here are some of the naked facts in
the matter:&mdash;</p>

<p>“France has 38,000,000 of population, 11,995 doctors,
while it graduates 624 medical students in one year. Germany
has 45,000,000 of population, about 30,000 doctors,
and graduates 935 students in one year. The United States
has about 60,000,000 of population, 100,000 doctors, 13,091
medical students, and graduates 3,740 students in one
year.</p>

<p>“Germany, which has relatively less than half as many
doctors as America, is already groaning over its surplus.
When one compares France with this country, the excess of
medical men here seems most astonishing.</p>

<p>“A comparison of the United States with European countries,
in whatever way it is made, leads one to think that
there is something almost alarming in our medical productiveness.”</p>

<p>In connection with the above comparison, in which it is
shown that Germany has proportionately less than half as
many doctors as the United States, it will be interesting to
learn the views of the German profession. The Berlin correspondent
of the Medical Press writes that the “Deutcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Ærztebund,” Society of German physicians, felt it to be their
duty to warn the guardians of young men studying in the
gymnasiums or high schools, against entering the medical
profession, the state of overcrowding being so great as to
<i>insure disastrous</i> consequences. In glancing over the above
figures, there is one very important point which is greatly
in favor of the German profession and militates against
the Americans. It is the enormous patent-medicine trade
and quacking that is done through it in the United States;
on the whole, this has been calculated to amount to at least
fifty per cent of all the doctoring that is done; that means,
that where one hundred doctors now practice for a living,
fifty more could make a similar living, were it not for the
patent and quack medicine trade, which, in some of the
German States, is almost prohibited, and in others I know
it is entirely inhibited.</p>

<p>When the Society of German physicians warns the German
people that an overcrowding “insures disastrous consequences,”
what does it mean?</p>

<p>This is a question which, we presume, was answered in
Germany, and it is certainly worth our while that we should
answer it here, and in this we have decidedly the advantage,
because in that country the answer was entirely based upon
what was anticipated, while in this we can answer from what
we have already realized, namely, disastrous consequences
to honor and to integrity on the one side, and to health and
security against imposition on the other. To this I have
already referred. Everyone competent of judging, and who
has lived in that country, knows from study and observation
that the arrangements and conveniences there for treating
the sick are in a much higher state of perfection than with
us. Hospitals and physicians are as accessible to all classes
as the most humane and philanthropic heart can desire,
and now we learn that if this wholesome state of affairs
shall continue with less than half the proportion of doctors
that we have here, there must be no further increase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
physicians, or it would insure <i>disaster</i>. This statement and
warning a close and careful observer clearly appreciates.
The writer was personally acquainted with a large number
of German practitioners while in that country, and knows
as an actual fact that while their fees were and are much
smaller than anything ever paid in this country, they had
not overmuch to do, and were only leisurely employed. This
applies to some of the greatest and world-renowned medical
professors, as well as to the ordinary general practitioners.
But there is a reason for all this, too. These men as a rule
are honest, they are no money grabbers, they are thoroughly
competent and scientific and manufacture no diseases to
suit emergencies nor conjure up complaints that have no
real existence. If their number were doubled, if the normal
proportion were disturbed, the <i>disaster</i> would surely follow,
professional demoralization would ensue. So the German
profession sounds a timely note of warning ere the canker
of selfishness has destroyed the noble altruistic principles of
physicians, without which the doctor is as likely to be a
messenger from hell as a ministering servant from heaven.</p>

<p>Medical legislation in this country has been nothing less
than a farce, partly because the general public is not aware
how abased the profession is, and partly that Americans
are extremely jealous of what they term personal liberty.
It is being attempted to remedy some of the abuses of the
medical profession by regulating the practice of medicine
by State Examining Boards. Experience has demonstrated
that these boards are but the excrescences of the various
medical colleges, who are themselves the root of the very
evils that are sought to be remedied. The duties of these
boards are simply to make themselves officious, and to inquire
into the source of the credentials or diplomas of the
applicants for a license to practice medicine, and not into
the qualifications or competency of the applicants. All that
is necessary under such laws is simply to present a diploma
of some sort; whether it was stolen, or the diploma of a dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
man, or gotten from any of the numerous worthless colleges,
is not made the subject of inquiry; and as by far the greatest
number of quack-salvers in this country have diplomas, the
law falls short of remedying quackery.</p>

<p>There are, usually, enough boards of examiners, representing
the different schools, so that the different interests of the
diploma manufacturers are well represented. A medical
examining authority whose functions and powers do not
go higher or beyond the mere granting of licenses, or which
does not examine into the qualifications of the persons who
possess diplomas, is utterly absurd, because it is no protection
against ignorance and imposition. A law that presumes
that all persons holding diplomas are qualified and
competent to practice medicine, is essentially wrong, or
inadequate to fulfill the purpose for which it was designed.
I have known graduates from what were considered good
colleges who could neither write a safe prescription nor diagnose
a case.</p>

<p>There is only one way towards an approach to an efficient
and intelligent board of medical examiners, and that is, one
single State board in which the different schools may be
represented as to their pet theories of prescribing medicines,
but in all other departments of medical science and art
there must be a uniformity of talent and qualification.</p>

<p>There must be a <i>standard of excellence</i> established by the
State, which is higher than and above the recognized standard
of any medical college, for no medical college is trustworthy
in this respect.</p>

<p>The State in its sovereignty must prescribe what shall
constitute a medical education, and the requirements should
be embodied in the statutes. A license or degree from that
source, after a final examination, should be the only legitimate
license to practice medicine.</p>

<p>Such a method would establish a system that would
clearly define the status of every medical practitioner. The
board must have the power, and it must be their duty, to
examine each and every applicant for a license, as all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
candidates for the army medical service are examined. All
this noise and talk about a preliminary examination and
an extended course of medical study are simply the vaporings
of superficial minds. It is neither the preliminary course,
nor the length of time that a person consumes in trying to
become a doctor, in which the public is interested, but what
kind of doctor a person is when he hangs out his shingle
and begins to practice, whether he is competent to do that
which is expected from him in the hour of sickness or great
peril, irrespective of any diploma or any medical college.
Foreign graduates should be amenable to the same examination,
for behind these, too, belongs the interrogation
point. The gushing mediocrity of some of these diploma
holders gives rise to the suspicion that their credentials are
not genuine.</p>

<p>As an American to the manor born, I would not for a
moment deny the humblest citizen an opportunity to elevate
himself to the highest professional honors; but why
can he not be required to thoroughly equip himself and
prove, by oral and written examinations on subjects of
preliminary education, that his mind has become disciplined
for broader or special studies, irrespective of any course in
a college? After the State has satisfied itself of the proficiency
of the applicant in scholastic acquirements, it should
go further, and examine into the qualifications for a degree
of medicine, just as they do in the <i>U. S. Army</i>, only with
this exception, that no diploma of any medical college
should be required from the candidate, and if he has one it
should not be recognized.</p>

<p>This would simply incorporate in the State laws the
distinctive feature of the University of London, which examines
and confers graduation on persons who have received
instruction in such institutions at home and in the colonies
as have satisfied a Secretary of State with regard to their
studies.</p>

<p>This university also has and exercises a power of examining
for degrees persons who have not been at any institution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Nothing could be more democratic than for the State
to make such a provision for State medical examinations.
The German Government does precisely the same thing,
with the exception that it makes graduation from the medical
department an essential prerequisite. It has a State
board of examiners to examine all graduates in medicine
of their own universities, to further prove if they are really
qualified. A diploma in Germany is of no value; it is the
so-called <i>ærzliche Approbationspruefung</i>, <i>State’s examination</i>,
that gives the license to practice legally.</p>

<p>When this is found necessary, notwithstanding the high
standard of German medical schools, how much more is this
safeguard against incompetency needed with us? I have
endeavored to prove from the methods of Germany and the
course of the <i>United States</i> medical department that diplomas
cannot be accepted as <i>bona-fide</i> evidence of a medical
education. With us a half dozen doctors can get together
any time, incorporate a medical college, call themselves professors,
and start out advertising themselves and their college
for the purpose of manufacturing diplomas and doctors.
Why, a diploma under these conditions should not be worth
the parchment it is written on, as evidence of a medical
education, unless attested by a higher and perfectly independent
authority!</p>

<p>If the public once understood that too many doctors are
dangerous to the morals and health of society, they would
be quite as anxious as the most enthusiastic medical educator
to remedy the evil.</p>

<p>The question of too many doctors is one of economical
and social science, not of medical science, and, therefore, it can
only be intelligently considered from these philosophical
standpoints. It is a well-understood and accepted law of political
economy that in the industrial pursuits, whether in the
manufacturing departments or in agricultural production,
the surplus or glut in the market of any of the products of industry,
reduces the price and stimulates consumption, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in the course of time, is regulated by a suspended or reduced
production, thus restoring a healthy equilibrium. It would
be an absurdity to apply the same rule to a surplus of doctors,
because human ills or diseases do not increase in proportion
to the surplus of doctors, nor will fees be any less.
But the surplus, in order to live, must live on the earnings
of the community, and here the disastrous consequences
appear.</p>

<p>The credulous, and those who often may imagine that
they require medical advice, become the unconscious victims
of the unhealthy disproportion, for the doctor seizes the opportunity
to make a case, while the normal proportion of
cases do not reach around. Thus, it is calculated that at
least fifty per cent. of all the diseases for which patients are
treated are fictitious as far as actual disease is concerned, and
the remaining fifty per cent. are, in the majority of instances,
overdosed and overdoctored. For this reason medical legislation
would not make a privileged class of physicians, nor
throw unusual safeguards around medical practitioners, but
medical legislation is to protect the people themselves from
imposition and quackery.</p>

<p>The reason for the overcrowded state of the profession is
not alone the laxity of medical laws, or the low standard of
medical education in most of our colleges, but the general
tendency of the country population to drift into the cities.
Honest labor has not the dignity which its importance demands,
and a radically faulty method of common-school education
is another reason. Utilitarian manual methods, in
which the hands are educated for useful employment and
the minds to habits of industry, are to be wished for. Young
men who have acquired a technical education in mechanics
and arts will learn to respect labor in every department,
and their ambition in life will be greater than to swing a
cane or wear a silk tile.</p>

<p>In proportion as the productive employments are made
respectable, this questionable ambition to become M. D.’s will
fall off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>History tells us that the opulence of Rome was speedily
accompanied by a decline of its agriculture, after which
came the fall of the Roman Empire, because the country
population became too indolent and restless and flocked to
the cities for an easier and luxurious living. History in
this respect seems to be repeating itself. We are always
talking of encouraging the beauty and growth of our cities,
but not one word of encouraging agriculture; no one talks
of encouraging farm life and making it profitable and attractive,
so that men and women would prefer the more independent
subsistence in the country to a shabby gentility in
the city. Some reader may ask, What has all this to do with
doctoring? I say that the answer must already have been
apparent; it becomes the duty of everyone to interest himself,
that the division of labor shall be apportioned so as to
do the greatest good to society.</p>

<p>We have a national characteristic which shows itself in
an abnormal conceit for everything American in a degree
that is not essential for true patriotism and love of country.
But when by comparisons we learn that there are abuses
and errors which are destructive to a healthy intellectual
and material growth, we must have the honesty and independence
to acknowledge them, and busy ourselves to find
a remedy for existing evils.</p>

<p>The physician who can assist in the amelioration of
society by administering to human ills which are the result
of unwise laws, is accomplishing as much good as if he
writes prescriptions or <i>bleeds</i> patients. The sooner everybody
recognizes the fact that the time has come to deflect
the current of ambition from the practice of medicine as a
means of making a living, the sooner will untold suffering
be lessened, and there is no honest-minded physician who
does not heartily agree with me. Mercenary persons, and
ignorant or unscrupulous doctors who run diploma mills,
may criticise severely the honest sentiments here expressed,
but the truth is so apparent, that he who runs may see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the inevitable consequence of this unhealthy competition.
Professors of colleges have a direct interest in the ignorance
and incompetency of their graduates, because they are the
means of calling them into consultation on every possible
occasion in trifling ailments, and if the disease belongs to
some specialty, they have the cases entirely turned over to
them, because, in the mind of the incompetent and newly-made
doctor, the professor who was the means of getting
him a diploma, poses as the <i>beau ideal</i> of medical wisdom.
In this way it becomes exceedingly profitable to be a professor.
If there are not enough medical colleges in a community
to afford places for the ambitious, it is considered to
be one of the best-paying financial investments for a company
of physicians to start one, and in most of these concerns
it is easier to get a diploma as a doctor than to learn
to be a good dressmaker or shoemaker.</p>

<p>Hence there is only one remedy to control the educational
aspect of this evil, and that is to take medical colleges
entirely out of the hands of private individuals and make
the State the only source of the necessary credentials to
practice medicine.</p>

<p>An American system of medical education fostered by
the State would be productive of grand results, because,
under the shadow of our free institutions, the mind transcends
the circumscribed sphere of despotism. This has
already been proven in numerous instances, notwithstanding
unfavorable surroundings.</p>

<p>Forming the galaxy of great names that illumine the
milky way of science, there are none brighter than a Gross,
a Flint, a Sims, and some others. These were great American
authors and physicians, who never pretended anything
else; they never dreamt of the Don Quixotic escapade of
pretending to be American professors while they appended
to their names initials or abbreviations of questionable
credit from foreign institutions. The brilliancy of true
genius was their only passport to fame.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">DELUSIONS AS TO THE CURATIVE VALUE OF
DRUGS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medicines</span> that are sure cures for all the diseases to
which humanity is heir, are not the spurious discoveries of
the quacksalver and patent-medicine vender alone, but
some very intelligent persons believe that if there is not a
panacea, there is at least a remedy, for every disease. In
cases where the patient does not recover, they believe that
either the disease was not thoroughly understood or the
medicines which were given were not properly selected.</p>

<p>This is a great error, because there is no such thing as a
specific or infallible remedy for any disease, and, on the
other hand, it is quite possible that most patients, with
proper nursing and diet, would naturally recover without
any drugs or medicines whatever. Outside of those drugs,
like ether, chloroform, opium, or morphine, that are employed
for the purpose of deadening the sensibility of the
nerves, so as to render them insensible to pain, there is not
another drug that is absolutely sure and true in its medical
effects. Some few are very useful at times, but the great
bulk of medicines do much more harm than good.</p>

<p>Medicine in its broad sense means a knowledge of the
cause, course, treatment and ultimate results of disease.
The study of medicine cannot be circumscribed by dogma
or theory, nor can it be mastered in a few short years of
study at the very best medical schools. It requires a mind
adapted by nature for a plodding investigation of her laws,
and incessant application, long after the college curriculum
is ended. In fact, the student must unlearn much of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
stereotyped lessons of the text-books, and this is particularly
true of the supposed medicinal effects of drugs, which are
always exaggerated. When physicians really have a threatening
case, under their observation and care, the attributed
therapeutic action of drugs is nearly always disappointing,
and very often injurious, and they are forced to let the drugging
entirely alone, and bring their skill to bear on measures
which support the strength and vitality of the system,
so that nature can effect a cure in her own way. This
may seem to some simple doctoring, but I can assure the
reader that it requires the highest degree of medical skill,
notwithstanding the droll sarcasm of Voltaire, that “medical
science is the art of amusing the patient while nature
performs the cure.” There is neither skill nor much learning
required to give an ordinary prescription; that the average
apothecary could do with the greatest exactness. But
science and medical skill can be exhausted in managing
and husbanding the resources of nature, in order to effect
a cure.</p>

<p>Medicine no longer stands alone as a simple art, based on
theoretical deductions, as it was less than a hundred years
ago, but it has become a department of natural science, a
part of the natural history of the human race.</p>

<p>Disease is as much a vital process as health, only in one
case the vital function is perverted, or destructive, while in
health it is constructive. The germ theory of disease and
cellular pathology are clearly within the domain of biological
research, while chemistry has solved many physiological
processes. Mental philosophy has been no less
serviceable in the department of medicine, by teaching the
wonderful influence of thought and emotions on the physiological
functions of the organs.</p>

<p>A one-sided education is inadequate to appreciate the
subject of healing or teaching. A comprehensive knowledge
of all that bears on the subject of health and disease
has several important objects in view, namely, it thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
acquaints the doctor with all of nature’s resources for the
amelioration or cure of disease; and it gives him judgment
in all cases to avoid irreparably wrong treatment, which
places obstacles in the road of nature’s efforts to heal
spontaneously. The quack or professional imbecile will,
in the ordinary course of diseases, be accredited with remarkable
cures; in fact, the cures wrought by a quack or an
ignorant person are just as welcome and valuable to the
patient interested as if they were accomplished under the
advice of the most erudite and skillful physician, but the
invalid ran the chances of malpractice or bad treatment
at the hands of the quack, which might have cost him his
life, because the incompetent healer does not know when his
method of treatment does mischief. Every method of cure
may possess merits of its own, which are beneficial when
the disease or conditions for its employment are present,
whether this is mind cure, water cure, or anything else that
you may name. All that any system of treatment can do
is simply to stimulate the curative force of nature, which is
the only <i>first cause</i> of any cure.</p>

<p>The reparative energy of nature has never been duly
recognized, because the selfishness and pride of the doctors
will not concede this as often as they ought. The doctor
should be the most useful as a monitor to the sick, in guiding
and controlling thought and conduct, in harmony with
the curative energy of nature. From this point of view the
pretensions of anyone effecting this or that cure are only
a delusion, because the doctor effects nothing, he only assists,
guides, and directs towards effecting a cure. What this curative
force is has by no means been understood. Some
believe it identical with life or vital action, which manifests
itself only in organized substances, but even if we admit
this identity, we are balked again, because we do not really
know what life is, any more than we know what electricity
is. Descartes resolved life into matter and motion; this,
however, is rather the phenomena of life and gives us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
no idea of the real essence of the force that we call life.
There is another theory, that all life whenever or wherever
found is a spiritual force, ethereal and universal. For our
purpose, the discussion of this question has no particular
value, were it not for the fact that life, or vital activity,
wherever we find it in organized substances, whether in the
lowest living thing or in the highest type of physical development,
is accompanied by or is endowed with the natural
tendency to repair defects or injuries in that in which it is
active.</p>

<p>Regeneration, or the curative process of nature, is always
the handmaid of vital activity. It is present at the earliest
formation and division of a cell, which constitutes the unit
of all organisms. Just as one brick is laid on the other with
mortar or cement between them, so as to make a whole wall
of a building, so are our bodies built up of minute cells, one
added to the other, with cement between them, until the
entire structure is completed. There is no tissue of the living
body which was not at one time during its existence a
cell. This curative force is beautifully illustrated in the
lower animals, where parts of organs are replaced to a far
greater extent than among warm-blooded animals.</p>

<p>Professor L. Landois, in his work on “Human Physiology,”
says that “when a <i>hydra</i> is divided into two parts, each
part forms a new individual&mdash;nay, if the body of the animal
be divided into several parts in a particular way, each
part gives rise to a new individual. The <i>planarians</i> also
show a great capacity for producing lost parts. Spiders and
crabs can reproduce lost feelers, limbs, and claws; snails,
part of the head, feelers, and eyes, provided the central nervous
system is not injured. Many fishes reproduce fins, even
the tail fin. Salamanders and lizards can produce an entire
tail, including bones, muscles, and even the posterior part
of the spinal cord, while the triton reproduces an amputated
limb, the lower jaw, and an eye. This reproduction requires
that a small stump be left, while total extirpation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the parts prevents reproduction. In amphibians and reptiles
the regeneration of organs and tissues, as a whole,
takes place after the type of embryonic development, which
is by cell division, and the same is true as regards the histological
processes which occur in the regenerated tail and
other parts of the body of the earth worm.” Comparative
pathological anatomy clearly demonstrates the inherent
curative power of nature, and this is also apparent in the
vegetable kingdom, and together they deliver a lecture on
the “art of healing” from the stage of creation, in silent and
modest language, but eloquently instructive to the thoughtful
observer.</p>

<p>The question now naturally arises How far this curative
energy of nature operates in warm-blooded animals, and
especially in man? The answer must be that, while it falls
short of reproducing parts of organs or even tissues in the
same degree of perfection as in the lower orders, the innate
tendency towards regeneration and recovery from injury
and disease is, on certain lines, practically the same. There
is not the slightest doubt that ninety per cent. of all cures,
whether the invalid took this, that, or the other medicine, or
whether the method of treatment was homeopathic, allopathic,
or mind cure, are entirely due to this inherent curative
energy; and the other ten per cent. may have required
some active remedy, but this, too, alone, without nature’s
healing force, would have been ineffectual.</p>

<p>What is ordinarily termed mind cure is not mind cure
in the sense that the term implies, but it is simply the mind
toying or playing with the idea of a cure, for while the mind
is thus engaged, nature’s energy is accomplishing the result
or cure. This is the only rational explanation, and corresponds
with the cures that nature is continually making in
the lower orders of animals. If the recovery of the sick
depended entirely upon the caprice and wisdom of the
doctor, and not on the reparative forces of nature, the race
would soon die out. I fully recognize the fact that the curative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
force can be stimulated; this may be done through the
influence of nourishing food, alcoholic stimulants, a drug or
medicine, or through purely mental influences. No physician
can estimate how much merit he can accredit to the
methods or substances he employs in any particular case
that recovers, and how much to the lady physician, Dame
Nature. This old lady doctor is ever active, and the most
inert drugs, employed or administered with her assistance,
have achieved wonderful cures; this the history of medicine
confirms. The tar water cure of Bishop Berkeley is an
illustration how an inert substance is capable of making for
itself an enviable reputation for curing ailments, like pleurisy,
pneumonia, erysipelas, asthma, indigestion, hypochondria,
and other diseases. This remedy had the vehement
indorsement of one of the greatest metaphysicians of the
English-speaking world, and that the cures reported by him
were genuine no one will doubt for a moment; but the
bishop, like many of our day, was determined to have a
remedy to cure disease, where none was required, but the
mind had to be humored, while nature was actively repairing
the disorder. To-day almost everyone is satisfied, that
the virtues ascribed to tar water by Berkeley were a delusion,
which was shared by all those who believed as he did.</p>

<p>The Weapon Ointment affords another instance where
the credulity of the public was supported by abundant facts
to prove the efficacy of the remedy, yet it was based on the
wildest superstition. This ointment was employed for the
healing of wounds, but instead of being applied to them, the
weapon with which the wound was inflicted was carefully
anointed and hung up in a corner, and the wound was
washed and bandaged without the salve being allowed to
touch it. This ointment created such a furor that eminent
medical men indorsed its virtues as a healing agent. Another
example of superstition and charlatanry was the
equally famous Sympathetic Powder, which, when applied
to the blood-stained garments of wounded persons, cured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
their injuries even when miles away. That dukes and
knights vied with each other to obtain the secret of its
preparation and ingredients is a matter of history. Instances
of delusions on medical subjects could be multiplied
a thousand fold, but they prove nothing but ignorance and
superstition on the one side, and the inherent all-powerful
curative force of nature on the other. While I wish to
avoid wounding the fastidious and sensitive in the matter
of their faith in their cherished system of cure, I cannot
refrain from classing homeopathy as a similar delusion.</p>

<p>I am glad to admit at the outset that I have read
Hahnemann’s “Organon of the Art of Healing” with a great
deal of interest and some profit. I am convinced that his
theory of infinitesimal dilutions is as absurd and ridiculous
as either the Weapon Ointment or the Sympathetic Powder
treatment already referred to.</p>

<p>If we consider the harsh, or, preferably-termed, <i>heroic</i>
treatments, then in vogue, we need not be surprised that the
pendulum of medication should have swung in the opposite
extreme. Blood was drawn from the already enfeebled
body, emaciated by disease; emetics were administered to
sensitive and inflamed stomachs, and only aggravated into
greater disorder; blisters, or the burning moxa, scorched into
greater agony the suffering mortal, while large doses of
drastic cathartics depleted the waning forces of nature.
There was a tendency of the medical profession about that
time to entirely ignore the <i>curative forces</i> of nature, and to
attack disease as you would a midnight marauder, with the
most powerful and dangerous weapons at command; and
there is no doubt that with these powerful expedients, disease
was destroyed, but life also. Under these conditions Hahnemann
appeared on the scene, and I am frank to admit that
he rendered suffering humanity invaluable service by espousing
a system of cure which had the merit of being
harmless. If we take into account that physiological studies
were then in their infancy, and that the word “Biologie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>”
from the Greek words which signify a discourse upon life
and living things, was made use of for the first time by
Lamarck, in a work published in 1801, it will not seem
altogether strange that even learned men were mystified
into beliefs which, in the light of our present knowledge of
the subject, appear preposterous. This was a most opportune
time to fasten on the healing art any doctrine or
dogma, however absurd, and on this tide of ignorance and
superstition, the doctrine of infinitesimal dilutions floated
into popularity. Homeopathy affords us one of the most
striking illustrations of the uselessness of drugs in ordinary
ailments, and conclusively proves that nature possesses inherent
curative powers. Cases treated under this system
make splendid recoveries, and often much better than when
the powers of nature are opposed or weakened with nauseating
drugs and poisonous doses, prescribed by incompetent
persons.</p>

<p>Hahnemann truthfully observed that existing diseases
are liable to become aggravated, complicated or replaced by
<i>drug diseases</i>.</p>

<p>There is no doubt of the truth of this statement where
drugs are heedlessly administered. When I was a student
I was told that <i>calomel</i> was par excellence a babies’ medicine
without any qualification. I was credulous enough
to believe it and prescribed it for my own children for its
purgative effect whenever it was deemed necessary. In later
childhood, when the second dentition set in, the germs of
the permanent teeth were so injured, evidently from the
calomel that had been absorbed into the system, that
the teeth were ragged and defective. The glands of the
neck were also inclined to swell and suppurate, and there is
no doubt in my mind that a great deal of what is generally
supposed to be scrofula in young children, is nothing more
nor less than a “drug disease.” I believe that Hahnemann
was cognizant of the potency of nature under ordinary circumstances
to cure disease. I believe that he absorbed this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
view of the philosophy of healing from the writings of Paracelsus,
which he had studied, and from which he drew his
inspiration, but he also appreciated the practical necessity
that success depended on satisfying the superstitious belief
of the times, and that consisted in offering some tangible
remedy. Hahnemann proved himself equal to the emergency
by formulating his doctrine of potentizing drugs or medicinal
substances by reducing them to a wonderful degree of
minuteness.</p>

<p>The preparation of these dilutions was directed to be
carried out in a ceremonial sort of way. Chalk from an
oyster shell, sulphur, charcoal, or any other substance, was
potentized by taking one grain of the drug and mixing it
with one hundred grains of sugar of milk. Of this mixture
one grain was taken and mixed in the same manner
with another hundred grains sugar of milk. This gave the
ten-thousandth of a grain of the drug. Take one grain of
this with another hundred grains of sugar of milk and
the powder will contain the millionth of a grain of the substance,
or the first potency, which forms the bases of other
dilutions. This is reducing the doses of any drug to an absurdity,
and Hahnemann was too brilliant a mind not to
know this. It might be mentioned in connection with these
dilutions, that if one grain of the most powerful drug, strychnine,
aconitin, arsenic, or any other chemical that is known,
is mixed with six hundred grains of sugar of milk, one
grain of this powder, or the one six-hundredth of a grain of
this substance, cannot be detected by any test or chemical reagent;
or, in other words, the quantity of the drug or chemical
contained is so small that the most delicate chemical test fails
to show it; yet, in homeopathy, the dilutions are carried to the
decillionth of a grain, from which important medical effects
are expected.</p>

<p>Drugs are physical agents, and if they are diluted so
as to destroy their chemical or physical properties, it is sheer
nonsense to expect any physical result from them on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
system. Chemical and physical facts conclusively prove the
utter inertness of certain drugs either in themselves or in
the manner in which they are employed, and the indisputable
evidence of biological science demonstrates the natural
curative tendency of nature observable in the lowest living
thing to the highest, so that we should stultify our reason
were we to arrive at any other conclusion than that the
doctrine of this therapeutic creed is one of the most irrational
delusions that ever befogged the mental horizon of a thinking
being.</p>

<p>The supposed cures effected through the employment of
the Weapon Ointment, the Sympathetic Powders, the endless
dilutions of the Hahnemann system, and, indeed, most
other remedial agents from any school or source, whether
offensive powders, mixtures, or patent medicines, or the
more agreeable and tasteless pellets, have but <i>one role to play</i>,
that is, to assuage the apprehensions of the mind while
nature is performing the cure; that is, to engage the
mind with the thought or idea that something tangible is
being done to bring about a certain result.</p>

<p>If the patient has pinned his faith to the curative value
of mind alone, the mind is for the time being engaged
with idea that <i>mind</i> is performing the cure. This is a delusion
quite similar to the previous one, in which medicines
are taken, with only this difference, that while you pin your
faith on drugs in the one case, you pin it to mind cure in
the other.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">WHAT IS MIND CURE?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> subject has given rise to an endless variety of contradictory
discussions, and while it has won for itself fanatical
devotees on one side, it has been ridiculed on the other. This
is not at all surprising, when an inquiry is made into the
competency of the parties to the controversy. To be informed
in metaphysical philosophy, or fully equipped in
scriptural lore, but without a practical study in the art and
theory of medical science, precludes the possibility of presenting
the theme in a logical manner, or establishing a relevancy
between medical science and mind cure. A medical
education that is based on strictly physical characteristics of
disease, as they are studied at the bedside, or in a microscopical
laboratory, is equally inadequate; for the question of
mind cure goes beyond the physical into the metaphysical,
and not until the operations of the mind have been closely
followed to the bodily or organic functions, can the intimacy
of their relations be thoroughly appreciated. Medical men
betray their incapacity for observation if they contemptuously
dismiss the subject of mind cure by some superficial,
disparaging illustration, for there is much more in the subject
than is dreamt of, even in the mind of the average
college professor.</p>

<p>“The mind,” says Dr. W. F. Evans, “can be made the
plastic or formative principle of the body, and that thought
can retard, pervert, or stimulate and correct the different
functions of the human organism.” The relation of spirit
and matter is very intimate, and some very clever thinkers
resolve all matter into spirit, in its ultimate analysis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Bishop Berkeley affirms this in his “Principles of Human
Knowledge.” In section seven he says “there is not
any other substance than spirit.”</p>

<p>If we view nature from a materialistic standpoint, we
see only one-half of what we think we do, and even that
must be very imperfectly judged by our senses. Friedrich
Wilhelm Joseph Schelling states the relation of matter and
spirit, in very simple and plain words, so that a child can
understand what he says: “Nature is spirit visible, and
spirit, is invisible nature.” This may be illustrated in physical
science from what chemistry teaches of the physical
properties of the <i>diamond</i>, whose atoms or molecules are so
perfectly continuous and closely aggregated that it forms one
of the hardest substances known to physicists. These atoms
of pure carbon may be made to repel each other, so that the
diamond assumes a gaseous state, which is imperceptible to
our senses.</p>

<p>I am aware that the definition of a gas is not that which
metaphysicians would accept as applicable to spirit, and
yet it illustrates the idea from a physical standpoint. It is
much better to illustrate a question with something with
which people are generally familiar. The body and every
organ and tissue forming a constituent part of it, is simply
the plain ordinary matter in motion, vitalized by what we
call life, and this life principle is a mystery, and what is true
of the diamond is true of the human body in its entirety.
If placed in a crematory, it is reduced to a few ounces of
bone ash, and, with the addition of a little acid, this too
would soon disappear into invisible gases, so that the doctrine
of philosophers, that matter is spirit, is, after all, not
so far removed from physical evidence.</p>

<p>Physiological science gives abundant proof that the mind
has a powerful influence over the body. By mind is meant
all that class of mental phenomena called reason, and the
emotions and passions. Doctor Evans says “the body is included
in the being of the mind,” or, in other words, that
matter is included in the being of spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The thinking quality of the mind is undoubtedly the
mainspring of its action, of which the formation of ideas
is the highest kind of mental activity. These originate
either within the mind or are brought within its sphere by
transformed impressions from without, but through the
power of the Will these are more or less modified, and may,
indeed, be entirely suspended, so that the mind may become
entirely passive and not think of anything. It is the exercise
of this Will power which may make the operations of
thought conducive to health or disease.</p>

<p><i>Cogito ergo sum</i>, “I think, therefore I am,” is a maxim of
Descartes. What we think and give shape to in thought
has for us a real existence, and we have it in our power to
create thoughts that will have either a painful or pleasurable
sensation. Painful sensations have occurred to persons
by the conviction of the existence of a cause which would,
when present, have produced certain results. Of this several
examples are given in W. B. Carpenter’s physiology:
“A clergyman told me that some time ago suspicions were
entertained in his parish of a woman who was supposed to
have poisoned her newly-born infant. The coffin was exhumed,
and the coroner, who attended with the medical
men to examine the body, declared that he already perceived
the oder of decomposition, which made him feel faint, and
in consequence he withdrew. But on opening the coffin it
was found to be empty, and it was afterwards ascertained
that no child had been born, and consequently no murder
committed.” The second case is yet more remarkable: “A
butcher was brought into the drug store of Mr. Macfarlan,
from the market-place opposite, laboring under a terrible
accident. The man, on trying to hook up a heavy piece of
meat above his head, slipped, and the sharp hook penetrated
his arm, so that he himself was suspended. On being examined
he was pale, almost pulseless, and expressed himself
as suffering acute agony. The arm could not be moved
without causing excessive pain, and in cutting off the sleeve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he frequently cried out. Yet when the arm was exposed, it
was found to be quite uninjured, the hook having only traversed
the sleeve of his coat.” In this, and similar cases, the
sensation was perfectly real to the individual who experienced
it, but it originated in the mind by an impression through
the nerves of <i>internal sensation</i> which created the idea
or image in the brain, and the <i>external senses</i> to which
it was referred had nothing to do in causing the feeling.
Diseases are thus created every day, either by ourselves or
by those to whom we go for advice. I call to mind a lady
who had gone to a distinguished practitioner for a supposed
womb disease for some six months. She experienced no
change for the better, but kept on growing continually
worse, so that she no longer had a refreshing sleep, and her
appetite for food was entirely gone. On examination I
found her womb entirely healthy, in fact, exceptionally so,
thanks to her attending physician, because, after a certain
amount of useless doctoring, the rule is quite the other way.
I told this lady of her error or delusion respecting her womb,
and prescribed a quieting mixture for the night and a tonic
for the day. She began at once to improve, and when I
saw her again, six weeks afterwards, she had so fleshed up
that I failed to recognize in her traces of her former delusion.
The disease of which this woman was suffering was imaginary,
and had no real existence for anyone outside of herself.
She was the victim of the harrowing symptoms which
her mind conjured into shape, and an attempt to brush aside
the disease, with the flippant remark that “there was nothing
the matter with her,” would have been cruel, unscientific,
and absurd. The ailment which she thought she had, had
as much an existence as though the most malignant disease
was destroying her life; for her imaginary disease was doing
the same thing, only in a different way.</p>

<p>Imagination is the most powerful function of the human
brain. Associated with thought, it constitutes the empire
of the soul, which recognizes neither time nor space. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
it we are brought into communion with everything that is
grand and beautiful in nature. Imagination is the architect
of our souls; it continually creates and projects into the
beyond; it enlarges the sphere of our thought in building
up artificial structures for our pleasure and entertainment.
When it becomes perverted and abnormal from false impressions,
either through the nerves of internal sensation or
through the nerves of external sense, or, what quite often
occurs, from morbid thoughts or ideas received from others,
it becomes equally potent in causing misery and disease.</p>

<p>Expectation or attention influences, in a remarkable degree,
the bodily functions. There are a great many persons
who keep themselves in misery and disease by always thinking
of their imaginary or real sickness. I had a profitable
experience some years ago in my own case, which conclusively
proved to my mind the aggravating tendency which
constant attention has on disease. I had contracted an ordinary
catarrh of the pharynx, or what is generally called a
sore throat. At first I did not mind it, but in the course of
time, from continued exposure in all kinds of inclement
weather, at all hours of the day or night, it fastened itself
upon me so that it was at times very annoying by its dryness
and pain. I do not know of anything that I did not
use, but, after a trial of several years, I was convinced that
the more I looked at it and the more I treated it with sprays,
gargles, etc., the worse it became, so that one day I resolved
to let it alone, and not think about it. I took a teasponful
of glycerine once in a while when it became too dry. For
years I have not looked at it, and for all I know, it is perfectly
well. I stopped bundling up my neck, used light
bedcovering, so as not to sweat, and by this simple method
accomplished what the very best selected drugs utterly
failed to do.</p>

<p>The great English authority, Daniel Hack Tuke, in his
work, “The Influence of the Mind on the Body in Health and
Disease,” quotes from Unzer’s work, published in Germany in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the year 1771: “Expectation of the action of a remedy often
causes us to experience its operation beforehand.” And
John Hunter said as early as 1786: “I am confident that
I can fix my attention to any part until I have a sensation
in that part.” A great number of cases are recorded
where complete insensibility to bodily pain has been induced
without the use of drugs. The intention of administering a
certain drug was made known in this manner. Bread pills
have acted as decided cathartics, and an empty chloroform
or ether bottle put the sensitive into a profound stupor or
insensibility.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse Braine, of the Charing Cross Hospital,
writes: “During the year 1862 I was called upon to give
chloroform to a very nervous and highly hysterical girl,
who was about to have two fatty tumors of the scalp removed.
On going into the operating room, it was found
that the bottle containing the chloroform had been removed
to the dispensary, and on testing the Snow’s inhaler, which
at that time I was in the habit of using, I found it to be
quite devoid of even any smell of chloroform. Then, having
sent for the bottle, in order to accustom the girl to the
face-piece, I applied it to her face, and she at once began to
breathe rapidly through it. When she had done this for
about half a minute, she said, ‘Oh, I feel it, I feel I am going
off,’ and as the chloroform bottle had not arrived, she
was told to go on breathing quietly. At this time her hand,
which had been resting across her chest, slipped down by her
side, and as she did not replace it, I thought I would pinch
her arm gently to see the amount of discomfort her hysterical
state would induce her to bear. She did not notice a
gentle pinch, and so I pinched her harder, and then as hard
as I could, and to my surprise I found that she did not feel
at all. Finding this was the case, I asked the operator to begin,
and he incised one of the tumors, and then, as the cyst
was only slightly adherent, peeled it away. At this time I
had removed the face-piece, and, wishing to see the effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
her imagination, I said to the operator, who was going to
remove the second tumor, ‘Wait a minute; she seems to be
coming round.’ Instantly her respiration, which had been
quite quiet, altered in character, becoming rapid as when I
first applied the inhaler, and she commenced moving her
arms about. I then replaced the face-piece, and her breathing
again became quiet, and she submitted to the second
operation without moving a muscle. When the water dressing
and bandages were applied, in answer to the question as
to whether she had felt anything, she said, ‘No; I was quite
unconscious of all that was done.’” The mental phenomenon
that we observe in this case clearly shows how completely
the sensation of the patient was suspended by the imaginary
chloroform, which existed only in her mind, yet the real
drug could not have been more potent in its effects.</p>

<p>Phenomena of the same mental process, like the different
colors of the solar spectrum coming from one source, constitute
the different stages or degrees of what is generally
called mesmerism or somnambulism, until the sensitive arrives
at that condition of complete double consciousness now
commonly called hypnotism, in which state the will
power of the person becomes entirely suspended, so that he
acts only from suggestions of another person, regardless of
propriety or consequences. When a subject who has been
completely hypnotized is restored to his normal condition,
he remembers nothing of what has transpired during the
somnambulistic state. We all have acquaintances of whom
we speak as being easily led; by that we mean that they
have no will or mind of their own. These persons are
truly unfortunate, because they are at the complete mercy
of every designing person or cunning rogue. They constitute
the large army of dupes who support the great number
of idle women and lazy men, who claim to be clairvoyants,
life readers and fortune tellers. In sickness they are equally
as credulous, and when they are a little out of sorts, they
would a great deal rather be told that some dangerous or severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
illness has hold of them than to hear the truth that,
outside of not eating properly, or clothing themselves improperly,
or being out late at nights when they should be in
their beds, there is nothing the matter with them.</p>

<p>These are the dupes who fill up the chairs in the doctor’s
waiting rooms, on regular days, for local or special treatment
for diseases which could be much better treated by themselves
at home, if they only were fortunate enough to fall into a
physician’s hands who had the honesty to tell them so. This
can be further illustrated by an experience of which every
one of us has been a victim at least once in our lives. When
we were trying on a pair of new shoes, we felt that they
pinched, or were too short and generally uncomfortable;
but the salesman insisted that they were a “perfect fit” and
that after a little wearing they would surely suit. The
shoes were bought, and we were convinced, after a few days,
that our impression of the smallness of the shoes was correct,
because they continued to pinch us; but we were for
the time mesmerized or psychologized by the clerk into buying
what we were satisfied in our own minds to be not what
we wanted. This should be constantly guarded against,
and our conscious will power should always be exercised on
all occasions.</p>

<p>Parents should take particular pains to cultivate the
will power of their children, in the right direction, of course.
To stifle the will of children, when the exercise of it entails
no bad consequences, is wrong, because it weakens their
character, and makes them the prey of the wicked and
selfish when they are grown to adult age. This influence
which one person may exercise over another is not due to
any particular force or magnetism, as was supposed by Mesmer,
and which is yet claimed by ignorant frauds and pretenders,
but it is simply a suspension of your own <i>will</i>, or a
sacrifice of force of character. Dr. J. M. Charcot, of France,
has lately taken up this subject, and has given it a great deal
of attention. His researches have confirmed the experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and conclusions of Braid, an English surgeon of Manchester,
who, in 1841, showed that, in order to produce artificial
somnambulism, there was no need of any extraneous influence,
and that any person of moderate sensibility can easily
produce in himself the “magnetic sleep” without any aid or
act of another.</p>

<p>Braid discovered that to simply fix the eyes for a few
minutes on some shining object, placed a little higher than
the ordinary plane of vision, and five or six inches from the
eyes, caused that total abstraction which Doctor Braid called
“hypnotism,” and which now, in honor of the experimenter,
is often called “Braidism.” This Doctor Charcot calls “impersonal”
sleep, artificially produced by mechanical means.
He remarks: “The psychic characteristic of the state of
somnambulism is an absolute trust, a boundless credulity
on the part of the subject toward the one who has hypnotized
him. Take one example from among a thousand: I
present to a woman patient in the hypnotic state a blank
leaf of paper, and say to her: ‘Here is my portrait; what do
you think of it? Is it a good likeness?’ After a moment’s
hesitation she answers, ‘Yes, indeed; your photograph!
Will you give it to me?’ The image being now fixed in her
mind, I take the leaf of paper, with a private mark, and mix
it with a score of other leaves precisely like it. I then hand
the whole pack to the patient, bidding her to go over them
and let me know whether she finds among them anything
she has seen before. She begins to look at the leaves one
after another, and as soon as her eyes fall upon the one first
shown, she exclaims, ‘Look! your portrait!’” This is the
latest phenomenon, and proves how the mind may print an
image on a substance, as the sun prints on a negative.</p>

<p>For persons of casual thought or reading, hypnotism
may at first appear complicated and mysterious, but if you
will only bear in mind that the different mental processes
operating between two persons always resolve themselves
into a <i>weaker</i> will power <i>yielding</i> and a <i>stronger</i> will power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<i>controlling</i>, you have a key which unlocks the different manifestations
of minds in their relations one with the other.
This does not relate to action alone, but to the creation and
meaning of our thoughts.</p>

<p>The cures effected by the royal touch, which prevailed
in England from the time of Edward, the confessor, to Queen
Anne, were but a disguised hypnotism, or a sort of mind cure.
Soothsayers, or magnetic healers, who claim a healing magnetism,
are either knaves or fools, and often both. They
undoubtedly can report cures, but these are due to the natural
tendency of some diseases to get well, and to the
hopeful thoughts which these persons inspire by their promises
of a cure; sometimes these hopes are heightened by the
different movements or passes which the healer makes.
The greatest healer of whom we have any reliable record
never claimed any abnormal power or force. Christ healed
by the Word, that means by the thought or mind. Faith
in anything creates a curative or healing thought in the
mind of the patient, which stimulates the reparative or healing
force of nature, and in this manner wonderful cures are
effected.</p>

<p>The faith, or confidence, which you have in a physician
stimulates you at once into a better or stronger feeling.
This has been the experience of every sick person, but this
is not due to any power or force that this person possesses,
which departs from him and goes over to you, but is
entirely due to the confidence, which stimulates your own
nerve centers, and especially the brain. The soothing and
quieting influence which the “Weapon Ointment” had on
the injured person was not due to any virtue of this ointment,
because it was never applied to the wound, but to the weapon
or implement which caused the wound. Its operations were
entirely mental or psychical. It pacified the excited and
anxious mind into the faith or belief that the best possible
thing to do was being done, and nature went on triumphantly
and effected the cure, for which, of course, she never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
got any credit. When a doctor or healer enters the chamber
of the sick, putting on a wise air, or indulges in affectation,
and when he succeeds in making a good impression, that
alone assuages the pain. But if, on the other hand, he impresses
his patients unfavorably, the sooner he gets out
of their sight, the better they feel, because his presence has
inspired neither confidence nor hope.</p>

<p>Hysteria constitutes a peculiar group of diseases which
belong to that class of nervous ailments that are included
among functional affections; they are oftener amenable to
faith or mind cures than to drugs. A great number of diseases
of women belong to this class and these poor deluded
creatures never had anything real or serious the
matter with them, until they went to some doctor who
began to apply irritating drugs to their delicate organs,
which made them ever afterwards habitues of doctors’ offices.</p>

<p>Functional diseases have a wide range. As their name
implies, they are characterized by a disturbance of the function
of an organ or system, without any visible alteration of
its tissue or texture; there are no pathological or histological
changes, which the most careful microscopic examination
can detect. They constitute a scapegoat for our ignorance;
it appears to be in the majority of instances a disturbance
between the psychic or spiritual forces as they operate on the
tissues. The normal and harmonious relations between the
mind and the body or any particular organ are disarranged.
Such are the hysterical convulsions or spasms which we
see in women who have suffered great mental strain, especially
grief, and often it is due to pure “cussedness,” or unbridled
passion. In men there is also a hysteria; it was formerly
believed that this peculiar nervous derangement was
confined to women only, hence the name, but this was an
error. I was once called to attend a physician of more than
average ability, who located in this city for the purpose of
enlarging his field of labor and usefulness; from where he
came he had been very successful. His reputation as a surgeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was enviable and deservedly so, but here, in this city,
among strangers and strange customs, he was a failure.
This preyed on his mind so that he became despondent and
gloomy. He failed in flesh and strength. I found him in
his room convulsively sobbing, which shortly turned into a
paroxysm of laughter. I prevailed upon him to return to
his former residence among his friends and admirers, which
he did, and he told me afterwards that from the moment he
struck his “old stamping-ground” he felt stronger and better,
and shortly recovered his former mirth and healthfulness.</p>

<p>Girls show this abnormal nervous function in different
ways. I have known a case where a sensitive girl accidentally
saw another girl in an epileptic fit; the contortions became
so real and fixed in her mind, or imagination, that they were
transmuted into motions or epileptic fits. I tried remedies
but without any beneficial results. The parents afterwards
went the rounds of the “fits doctors,” but with the same
negative results. A Christian scientist or faith healer cured
her, by cultivating or strengthening her will power.</p>

<p>There is a class of these faith healers, composed of silly,
loquacious women and men, who know nothing at all of the
principle governing their cures, and they glibly tell their
patients, “You must say or think there is no disease, or I
have no pain, or there is no body; all is well; all is good,”
and a great deal of similar nonsense. All is not good, and
all is not well by any means. I would say, Indeed there is
pain, disease, and a body, but by striving to live a healthful
moral life, and thinking healthful thoughts, of the good, the
pure, and the beautiful, the curative energy of nature will
become stimulated to repair the defects, to harmonize the
functions and dissipate disease.</p>

<p>A person who is troubled with dyspepsia cannot get well
if he thinks of nothing but an acid or sour stomach, or
feels the food disagreeing with him before he has it in his
mouth. He must have thoughts quite remote from these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and the chances are nine out of ten he will not feel what
he eats. There is the same state of mind about “catching
cold.” Some persons are forever on the alert to catch a cold,
and why should they not, when they are always watching
out for it? If you dress so that you do not sweat, and do
not use too thick bedcovering, and are not constantly on
the catch or lookout, I assure you you will not catch cold,
nor will it catch you.</p>

<p>Terror or fright causes or cures diseases. Dr. Toad reports
the case of a boy, in Tuke’s work, nine years of age,
who was frightened into chorea, or St. Vitus’ dance, by his
sister, who had covered herself with a white sheet and appeared
before him unexpectedly, while he was in bed. I
know, also, a case of functional bladder weakness of a child
who wet his bed at night during sleep. There appeared no
signs of any local disease, nor was any remedy which I employed
of the slightest advantage. The father of the child,
becoming exasperated, gave the child a severe thrashing one
morning. The mother remonstrated at what she considered
cruel and useless chastisement. But, strange yet true, that
child never wet the bed after that; it was entirely cured by
fright.</p>

<p>Sympathy will often make persons sick; of this I had in
my own experience an opportunity for a very interesting
observation. It was the husband of a woman who had been
retching and vomiting incident to the early months of her
pregnancy. So great was the sympathy of her husband that
he retched and vomited exactly like his wife, not only when
in her presence, but when separated from her, the impressions
or thought exciting the <i>excito-motor</i> nerves of the stomach.
This sympathetic sickness lasted as long as that of his
wife.</p>

<p>Dr. H. C. Sawyer, author of “Nerve Waste,” has kindly
shown the writer another form of functional or hysterical
disorder, which was, or is even yet, considered by many general
practitioners a scrofulous enlargement of the joints; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the doctor discovered the peculiarity of <i>metastasis</i>, which
means a sudden or complete removal of a disease from one
part to another. This gave the disease what he termed a
hysterical or functional character. It would be the swelling
of the elbow of one arm and the knee of the opposite side at
one time; and in the course of a few weeks or months these
would feel and appear entirely well, while the disease had
located itself in other joints. This case the doctor considered
could be only reached through the mind, or some faith
cure. He further believed that many of these enlarged and
swollen joints among the wealthier classes were due to a
nervous trouble. Indeed, it would be an easy matter to cite
case after case, from my own experience, or quote cases from
the highest medical authorities, illustrating in every conceivable
manner how the mind, the imagination, the emotions,
or the different passions, are continually causing disease
and suffering.</p>

<p>It must naturally follow that what is potent to induce
diseases will, under different conditions, be a means of curing
them.</p>

<p>A serious question now arises with reference to the selection
of cases suitable to <i>mind-cure</i> treatment. Bigoted
fanaticism is quite incompetent, so are the great majority of
spiritual healers, owing to their absolute ignorance of the
scientific aspects of disease. The first prerequisite for intelligent
and proper treatment is to establish the precise nature
of the disease under consideration. It must be distinctly
grouped or classed, whether it be a functional or hysterical
disease, or a zymotic or contagious affection.</p>

<p>In diphtheria or typhoid fever mind cure subserves no
purpose; the treatment must be avowedly antiseptic and
stimulating.</p>

<p>If it be a physical injury, say a fractured bone, it must
be treated on mechanical principles.</p>

<p>A woman suffering in the pangs of labor, which is being
delayed from some abnormal position or some other physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
obstruction, can only be delivered through mechanical
methods; and here the enthusiastic mind healer may commit
serious errors, sacrificing limb and life by unnecessary
delay. So I would lay down this broad maxim, that the
mind healer must either be a competent, educated physician,
or a physician should be a competent metaphysician.</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In the year 1887 Mrs. A. C. Hurrell was a healthy, middle-aged
woman and the mother of two children. When the youngest was
ten months old she contracted a severe cold. The coughing spells “took
her breath,” and from these exaggerated expiratory paroxysms she
drifted into <i>spasmodic asthma</i>, at least that was the diagnosis of prominent
medical men of Sacramento and of this city. Change of climate
was advised and tried, so were also the different drugs which experience
had taught to be useful, even operations were performed on her nasal
passages by enterprising specialists, but all to no purpose. Morphine
was prescribed by the first medical attendant, and when her suffering
became unbearable she had to fall back on this drug for relief. In May,
1890, I was consulted, but a most careful examination revealed nothing
which I could assign as a cause and upon which to base a hopeful treatment.</p>

<p class="pbq">In October, 1891, she was persuaded to take treatment from a lady
who claimed to cure through Christian Science (a mind healer). The
treatment commenced on a Thursday afternoon. The lady impressed
on her that the morphine, of which she now consumed, hypodermically,
the enormous quantity of ninety grains a week, was injurious, and that
if she made up her mind that there was no disease the asthma would
leave her. Friday night the patient was in great agony, both from the
withdrawal of the drug and the asthmatic attack, and this double pressure
weakened the faith of both patient and healer, but the husband
stood firm and insisted that she have no morphine. The struggle for
breath and the narcotic continued until four o’clock Sunday morning,
when she began to get easier; the improvement continued, and in ten
days she had “outgrown” both. I saw her two months later, entirely
recovered, and the most brilliant specimen of the efficiency of mind cure
that one could wish to see.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">GENERAL CAUSES OF UTERINE AND PELVIC DISEASES
OF WOMEN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> are womb diseases so prevalent? is a question
which we are not infrequently called upon to answer. At
first sight this would strike one as a casual or commonplace
remark, but a moment’s reflection makes it one of vital interest,
for a truthful and intelligent reply lays bare the causes
which undermine the health, strength and character of the
mothers of our citizens, and when a disease of this sort becomes
common, it threatens the morality, health and life of
our nation.</p>

<p>The causes which operate in producing these diseases of
the female differ widely in their origin; some are due to ordinary
imprudence, while others are deeply rooted in moral
depravity and marital abuses and for this reason I consider
it convenient to arrange them into three distinct classes or
groups.</p>

<p>The first class is characterized by comprising those
causes which are for the most part accidental. They are
peculiar to confinement and motherhood, and may be in a
great degree controlled or averted by the skillful and competent
accoucheur. They have principally a scientific interest,
and do not fall within the scope of the non-professional
reader.</p>

<p>The second class is entirely beyond anyone’s control.
The causes belonging to this category are innate to the human
organism; they induce those numerous afflictions
which here and there sprout up in previously healthy persons,
and are, in all probability, due to some specific hereditary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
taint. They are to be attributed to the natural imperfections
of humanity, and are a constant reminder that the
body is simply the transient abode of the soul, or spiritual
man, and as such only perfect in its imperfections. Like the
causes of the first class, these, too, have principally a scientific
interest.</p>

<p>The third class of causes of uterine diseases constitutes a
very large group, and has a popular or general interest. For
this reason it should be freely discussed, because the causes
of this class are <i>avoidable</i>.</p>

<p>They are entirely within the control of the average sensible
person, and for that reason should be known and understood
by everyone. These causes superinduce inflammatory
diseases, which are not confined to the womb alone but take
in the entire pelvic <i>appendages</i>, the Fallopian tubes and ovaries.
They are the greatest source of revenue to the doctors,
and vary in symptoms in different persons, from a slight
casual reminder of something wrong to harassing pains and
physical suffering; and that these all are brought about
through ignorance, wanton carelessness, or sinful disrespect of
nature’s or God’s law, is the characteristic feature of the causes
under investigation.</p>

<p>Exercise in the open air is so essential in strengthening
the nervous and muscular systems that where this is neglected
it predisposes to womb disease. I consider the differently-devised
indoor or room calisthenics or exercises as
totally inadequate and no substitute whatever for healthful
outdoor movement, and for the following reason: that while
it irritates the muscular and nerve fibers, it lacks the stimulating
and tonic influence of pure oxygen-laden air, so that
the blood becomes still more deteriorated and overloaded by
excessive waste material, which is not thrown off. If a person
exercise at all with a view of deriving physical benefits,
let it always be in the open air. Like walking, riding, rowing,
to which bicycling should be added as one of the very best of
outdoor exercises, the mind can then be engaged at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
time, though it must not be overstrained. The great obstacle
nowadays arises from a fashionable and morbid desire to cultivate
an appearance of delicacy; if, instead, recreations which
required muscular exertions were more fashionable, the results
in developing strong and hardy women would be astonishing.</p>

<p>No exercise can be profitable which is not interesting to
the person who practices it.</p>

<p>It is not the bodily exertion alone which can profit a person,
but the happy associations, the abandonment of self
thought, the mental relaxation, and the pleasure which accompanies
it. With one or two companions we can have a
jolly time, while taking a swimming bath or floundering in
the surf, but alone it soon becomes tiresome. If we take a
stroll with an agreeable companion, we can walk a distance
which, when undertaken alone, would fatigue and tire
us completely out, while, when with an associate or friend,
we cover the same distance refreshed and invigorated, because
the mind is entertained while the body is exercised.
This must have been the experience of everyone, and
if it teaches anything worth remembering, it teaches that
monotonous exercises should be avoided and entertaining
ones sought and practiced. Walks over hills in small, friendly
groups is one of the best modes of exercise I know of. And
then there remain the many outdoor games. The pernicious
systems of training which are observed in some female
seminaries often plant the seeds for future disease. All the
school hours are employed in reading, drawing, music, and
other brain work, while the evenings are devoted to preparing
lessons for the following day. This is very injurious,
and should never be permitted.</p>

<p>After school hours the mind should have complete respite
from study, so that the forces can recuperate themselves for
the next day.</p>

<p>Nervousness or neurasthenia is often a result of this excessive
mental application. Where the mind is constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
engaged in intellectual pursuits, the result often is a too
rapid development of the brain and nervous system.</p>

<p>When the thoughts and memory of girls of tender age are
too long and too laboriously engaged, there will be an
abnormal development of the nervous centers; they will
grow or develop beyond the muscular or physical strength,
and a morbid impressibility, great feebleness of the muscular
system, and a marked tendency to disease of the pelvic organs,
is established. Parents may refer with pride to the
precocious talents, the refined and cultivated tastes, of their
daughters, as qualities to be admired and appreciated, but
without a physical substratum it is a dreamy delusion. It
would be much better for the children if their parents took
more pride in rotund figures and robust constitutions, for these
would ever be a source of joy, while the cultivated talents,
especially at the expense of their health, will not only be of
little practical value to them in after years, but often incapacitate
them for wives and mothers, by making them restless,
discontented, and physically unfit for maternal functions.</p>

<p>There is entirely too much scholastic education imparted
to our girls, and not enough domestic education. I believe
that the most favored should not have too much of
one and not enough of the other, because if parents do not
prepare girls for household duties in early life, they run desperate
chances of laying the foundation for a failure in the
remote future.</p>

<p>Children must be constantly reminded that they are in
this world to serve a useful purpose, and that co-equal with
every accomplishment is a utilitarian training.</p>

<p>We take a pride if our boys trade pocketknives, especially
when our own gets the better one of the two, because
we appreciate the natural business trait. He will be no less
a good candidate for some of the learned professions, and, indeed,
it has come to this, that material success in the professions
depends as much on shrewd business tact as it does
upon proficiency in professional attainments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The knowledge or even wisdom of a person is of no earthly
use to himself or the world if he or she do not possess the
faculty of letting the people know of this superior wisdom;
and that is why some persons often become more celebrated
and even renowned than others, who are intellectually their
superiors, because the former possess the faculty and cunning
to make people believe in their superiority. By this I simply
desire to impress upon parents not to be over-anxious
about their daughters standing <i>first</i> in their class room, but,
rather, to be very anxious that they attain a healthy and
vigorous growth, and that sufficient practical knowledge of
domestic affairs be imparted to them so that they can creditably
fill their mother’s places some day. This I consider
the best legacy.</p>

<p>The time to commence to train mothers is from the moment
they are born. The minds of parents should be disabused
of the false delicacy about this aspect of a girl, and
while no one expects daily lectures to be given to children
or young girls upon the responsibilities which await them,
such information should not be studiously avoided. I insist
that this important fact should not be lost sight of, motherhood
is the ultimatum of feminine existence.</p>

<p>Mistaken conceptions of woman’s education, in pinning
girls to a life of close mental application, is often productive
of uterine disease, by lowering the tone of the nervous
system; while others who are ambitious to acquire a professional
education in later life, fall by the wayside as hopeless
invalids.</p>

<p>I do not disparage her capacity to study with equal
proficiency the arts and sciences, often with more ardor and
closer application, than her male colleagues, but she is simply
striving to accomplish that which the men can and do
willingly accomplish for her, while at the same time she
is neglecting the education of those qualities which are the
sole inheritance of her sex, and which man could not usurp
if he would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>This class of uterine diseases develops in a few years into
melancholy, which closes the windows of the soul to the sunlight
of hope, and gradually drags the sufferer into a decline,
that nothing but an entire change in the habits and thoughts
of the patient will ameliorate or cure.</p>

<p>I would have our girls as independent of our boys as the
latter are of our girls. I would have it understood that each,
in their specialty for which God and nature has ordained
them, is as honorable and important in the social and
industrial conditions of mankind as the other. I would give
woman the right, and deem it her privilege, to frankly
and unrestrainedly profess her fondness or desire to marry
the man who she believes would make her a desirable husband,
because woman’s intuition transcends man’s reason.</p>

<p>A reform in this direction would, indeed, elevate the
woman to man’s estate, where she belongs. A little less sentiment
and more sense is a wholesome panacea for some of the
abuses of the marital contract.</p>

<p>I fully subscribe to the view that a woman shall at all
times receive the same wages for her mental and physical
labor that men receive for the same work, but I am
entirely opposed to that modern tendency and false social
philosophy which is constantly striving to make a man out
of a woman. There is something so grossly absurd and unnatural
in this artificial readjustment of the natural duties
of the sexes, in their industrial and social relations, that it
has degenerated in many instances into fanaticism.</p>

<p>Women are organizing everywhere for the purpose of increasing
the facilities of their sisters in the studies of science
and philosophy. Large sums are offered to the faculties of
universities to gain admission to female students on an
equal footing with the male students, for the purpose of
studying some of the already overcrowded professions.
In the main, all this abnormal rivalry does not contribute a
single advantage to either sex.</p>

<p>There was a time in the history of civilized nations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and that time is not more than twenty or twenty-five years
ago, when an academical education gave an immense advantage
to its possessor over his less-informed contemporary,
but this is not true in our time, because there is now an overproduction
of college-bred men. The man who can decline a
Greek noun or conjugate a Latin verb is no longer a rarity,
because the sons of European tradesmen and American farmers
have deserted the pursuits of their progenitors&mdash;which, in
the case of the American farmers, is to be deplored&mdash;and obtained
a collegiate education, that is no longer the inheritance
of the privileged few, so that in our time and day an academical
education has run to seed among the men. And now the
attempt is being made, under the guise of social progress, to
burden our girls with the same wisdom that has incapacitated
many of our boys from making an honest and independent
living. It would be much better for the State if two-thirds of
our universities or high schools were changed into manual
training schools or polytechnical colleges, where the foundations
for the industrial pursuits may be laid, so that labor will
be made not only respectable but intelligent.</p>

<p>We would then hear of educated mechanics or artisans,
and scientific farmers, which, to my mind, requires the same
order of intelligence to excel, that it does in the professions
generally qualified as “learned.”</p>

<p>Why crowd our girls, then, into the professions for which
they are not only unsuited by nature, but which are already
demoralized by the keen competition within their ranks? It
is, certainly, an open secret, in the profession to which I have
now devoted the best years of my life, that the methods in
vogue to get business have descended to the level of the
“confidence trickster,” and that, no matter what ability or
merit a person may possess, without the natural instincts and
elements of the quack and charlatan he can gain neither a
livelihood nor fame. This theatrical demeanor of the profession,
this aping the gaudy display of European aristocrats
by riding in closed coaches, driven by liveried coachmen, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
but the outward symptom of the internal disease of contention
for notoriety and success.</p>

<p>If, instead of all this false and demoralizing philosophy,
termed “woman’s rights”&mdash;which is more appropriately
designated “woman’s wrongs”&mdash;we turn the thoughts and
ambitions of women towards domestic economy and domestic
virtue, which alone should be and ever will be the <i>ideal</i>
of noble womanhood, there will be, then, much less disease,
more happiness, and less discontent. There is enough on
God’s earth for all of his children to eat, wear, and work, if
the labor and the subsistence are fairly and wisely apportioned.</p>

<p>The growing sentiment, which is as vicious as it is absurd,
is that a girl, to be educated or accomplished, must be
either a teacher, lawyer, or doctor, or anything else except an
accomplished housekeeper, just as though it required less talent
or ability to raise a child, cook a wholesome or digestible
meal, and cut or sew a garment.</p>

<p>Why, there is much more thought and judgment required
in making an angel mother than in administering or
prescribing a dose of medicine and filing a legal brief, and
there is not a lawyer or doctor who has given sufficient
thought to the duties and requirements of maternity who
disputes it for a moment. If our strong-minded women
would preach this doctrine, which would tend to make household
duties respectable, they would be benefactors instead of
mischief makers, and then our comely girls would prefer to
cultivate habits of domesticity, which should and would become
as honorable an occupation as that of a doctoress or
lawyeress.</p>

<p>Improprieties of dress are to be found in excessive or
deficient clothing, in an improper adjustment, and in an
inherent defect of the undergarments. I will reserve some
of my views on these questions, for the chapter that is
devoted to hygienic measures. In the main, the custom or
manner of dressing women in Christian countries does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
deserve that sweeping denunciation that some radical dress
reformers make. I would not, if I could, change the very
becoming and graceful modern female dress, for it possesses
the merit of displaying the beauties of the figure in a modestly
delicate manner, and it hides its defects from the vulgar
gaze.</p>

<p>As a rule, there is too much pressure on the abdomen,
from the weight of heavy skirts that are suspended from the
hips, and not sufficient room for the chest to expand, so as
to accommodate the respirating movements of the lungs. In
the absence of shoulder bands, to which the skirts should all
be fastened, the much-decried corset has its redeeming qualities,
for it serves the purpose of a yoke or support for the
different undergarments, and when not tightly laced is
rather a benefit than an injury, and if the corset had a shoulder
strap fastened to it over both shoulders so as to keep the
garments from dragging on the hips, there could then be no
objection to it whatever. The corset must always be so
loosely worn as to permit the wearer’s hands to be easily
passed between it and the waist. It then becomes a useful
brace to a weakly woman and entirely harmless to a strong
or healthy one. We can imagine how a tightly-fitting corset
will cause mischief by compressing the ribs and abdominal
walls, and that this absurd fettering will prevent the
lateral expansion of the chest, and also injuriously press upon
the internal organs, but this is not due to an inherent property
of the corset itself, but to an abuse of it. One might as
well advocate a return to the Roman sandal, on the ground
that some persons are foolish and vain enough to wear shoes
altogether too small for their feet, thereby causing deformities
and corns. For my part, I admire a nice, well-shaped,
healthy foot, incased in a low, broad-heeled, comfortable shoe,
even if its size were one or two numbers larger than a pinched-up,
deformed one. But no one would be enthusiastic enough
on the question of healthy feet to have us all wear sandals
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Warmth of the lower extremities is a very important
point in a female’s apparel, and of more importance than all
the other questions raised on this subject. The exposures
endured by women, from ignorance or indifference to this
fact, is, in my experience, a fruitful source of disease. The
chilling blast which sweeps under the skirts must be mitigated
and the moist vapor arising from a damp and cold
earth neutralized. If the limbs are only protected by thin
cotton fabrics, they are insufficiently clad to avoid the evils
above mentioned. It is of the greatest importance that the
limbs of women should be incased in flannel drawers, and
these can be worn underneath the white muslin or linen ones,
and the hose, especially in cold or damp weather, should be
made of woolen material; the soles of the shoes should be
sufficiently heavy so as not to be permeable by the moisture
from the ground, and in wet or rainy weather rubber overshoes
are always a necessity. When the feet and lower
limbs are kept warm, the whole body is more or less protected
against cold.</p>

<p>Superfluous or too warm garments are the cause of an
endless variety of diseases. The rule is this, that any garment
which by its weight or thickness excites perspiration
when the wearer sits quietly or exercises moderately, is either
superfluous or too thick or heavy, and, as perspiration relaxes
and softens the skin, it makes one susceptible to take
cold. It is reported on good authority that sealskin wraps
cause more deaths among those who wear them than typhoid
fever and for the reason above mentioned. Loosely-woven
woolen goods make the best wraps and the best underwear.
If we were called upon to state a single proposition which
we considered of the greatest importance in preventing disease,
we would frankly say that, next to an irregular and
unwholesome diet, excessive clothing is the most mischievous
factor in causing or predisposing to disease.</p>

<p>The same rule applies to bedcovering; if it be so heavy
as to make the sleeper sweat during the night, he is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
sure to take cold from the sudden change, from a
warm, moist bed to the cool room or comparatively chilled
clothing.</p>

<p>Imprudence during menstruation. A heedless disregard,
ignorance, or carelessness of the precautions above referred to
is, during the catamenial days, quite sure to lay the foundation
for disease. Every practitioner has met with a great
number of cases where the disease originated during menstruation
from some indiscretion, and it ran on for years,
until a condition of affairs was developed which was well-nigh
incurable.</p>

<p>The female organism is particularly sensitive about this
time and much easier affected than at any other.</p>

<p>During this period the ovaries and uterus are intensely
congested, and the Fallopian tubes which connect the former
with the latter share this condition, and if a cold should suddenly
check or interfere with the natural functions of these
organs, it might result in inflammation of the ovaries or in a
catarrh of the tubes and womb. Any one of these conditions
is painful and often troublesome to cure, but when all these
organs are complicated in the diseased process, which we
frequently find to be the case, it may entail serious consequences.</p>

<p>Dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation, will be a prominent
symptom, if any of the above organs have suffered from
imprudence, during this period, and I have known of cases
which gave me no end of trouble before they were restored
to health.</p>

<p>Measurements of the healthy uterus. In a grown person
the average length is three inches, two inches in breadth and
an inch in thickness. It weighs from an ounce to an ounce
and a half. The size of the uterus is an important guide to
the physician in establishing the presence or absence of certain
diseases.</p>

<p>In the child-bearing period measurements and weight
change, because the organ grows correspondingly large to
accommodate the growth of the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Growth of the uterus from the moment of conception is
one of the most interesting physiological studies. All its
tissues, muscles, nerves, vessels, and lymphatics are increased
in bulk and multiplied in number. The human ovum is
an extremely minute microscopic cell, from one two-hundred-and-fortieth
to one one-hundred-and-twentieth of an inch in
diameter. This grows so rapidly that at the end of nine
months we often have the average nine-pound baby. The
growth of the muscular fibers of the womb is truly remarkable.
They grow eleven times longer and twice to four times
thicker, so that the growth of the womb keeps pace with
that of the child.</p>

<p>Changes immediately after confinement. Women as a
rule, and their husbands also, are wofully ignorant of the condition
of the womb just after confinement, and at this point
it will be opportune to impart the necessary information illustrating
that it is one of the most critical periods of the entire
process, because the pelvic organs are again very sensitive,
somewhat akin to the menstrual condition, namely, one of
engorgement, or congestion.</p>

<p>After the child is in the world, the uterus usually contracts
to about the size of a cocoanut; its measurements and
weight as compared with what it was before pregnancy have
materially increased.</p>

<p>The diameter is now about four inches, and its weight a
little over two pounds. If we now stop to reflect that its
weight was formerly an ounce to an ounce and a half, to
which size and weight it must again return, we can readily
appreciate the important changes that must take place to accomplish
this object. The scientific world has only learned
how this is effected within the last thirty years. It was a
very important discovery. The superfluous or excessive tissues
are converted into fat&mdash;the process is called <i>fatty degeneration</i>&mdash;and
as fat the tissues are absorbed into the blood and
disposed of, and thus gradually is the superabundant substance
removed, until its measurements are as they were formerly
and its weight as it was before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Involution is the name given to this process by medical
writers. It signifies a rolling back of the size and substance
of the womb to where it was before pregnancy. It is the
physiological activity in the tissues of the organ to restore it
to its former size and healthfulness. The time usually required
for nature to accomplish this remodeling varies in
different individuals from six weeks to three months.</p>

<p>Subinvolution is a term employed to designate a partial
or complete cessation of this restorative action. The prefix
<i>sub</i> means always <i>under</i>; in this case the same thing is meant,
<i>under-involution</i> or <i>incomplete</i> involution.</p>

<p>When, in six weeks to three months after confinement,
the womb has not returned to its previous healthy size,
weight and state, or if the enlargement of the womb incident
to pregnancy lasts longer than already specified, we have the
disease termed subinvolution. It generally becomes complicated
with inflammation of either the cavity of the womb or
of its entire substance, and often the inflammation extends
to all the other organs and tissues in the pelvis.</p>

<p>Indiscretion in getting up too soon may cause this state
of affairs. Taking cold and excessive exertion should be
guarded against.</p>

<p>A mother who has just been delivered must gradually
feel her way as to how much and what she may or can do
without jeopardizing her recovery. Pains in the pelvis, back,
and thighs, or a heavy, dragging sensation after getting up,
indicate a subinvolution. These symptoms should be attended
to, because the longer they last the more obstinate
the disease becomes.</p>

<p>Lying on the back after confinement for ten or twelve
days is not only injurious but an unnecessary hardship for
every mother. It is one of the most fruitful causes of an abnormal
position or falling back of the womb, and very often
this excites diseases which greatly complicate the improper
location of the organ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Retroversion and retroflexion of the womb will be considered
more minutely later on. It is generally caused by
this common error of nurses and physicians, who allow the
delivered woman to lie and often insist on her lying on the
back. Thus the womb gradually sinks backwards, instead of
falling forwards, where it belongs: see Plate IV.</p>

<p>Women will not generally feel that anything is wrong
until some time after they are up and around. The first few
weeks or months after confinement, persons are inclined to
attribute their weakness, pains in the back or thighs, and
other disagreeable sensations, to the natural consequences of
what they have gone through. But after weeks roll into
months, and their former strength and health do not return,
then they seek the advice of a doctor, who will disclose to
them the cause of their suffering. This can be avoided
every time by changing the positions of lying, from one side
to the other, and from the back to the stomach for a change;
then naturally the womb will gradually resume its normal
position, which is inclined forward and rests with its body
over and on the bladder. All of these displacements should
receive early and prompt attention.</p>

<p>Antiseptic precautions. Only a few years ago this phrase
was entirely unknown. It originated with the modern antiseptic
treatment of wounds, and from the domain of surgery
it has been transplanted into the department of obstetrics, in
which the application of antiseptic principles has achieved
the most brilliant triumphs. From this conception has
sprung the germ theory of disease, which is now, beyond
doubt, an established fact.</p>

<p>I never can forget my first case of <i>childbed fever</i>. It is
only fourteen years ago, and then there was as yet no one
who could give a scientifically truthful interpretation of the
disease. My patient was a young mother, who was being
rapidly consumed by a fever, but beyond that science had
not unlocked the causes lurking in the organism, which had
doomed the young woman, on the threshold of motherhood,
to a premature grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Thousands of lives were yearly destroyed by <i>puerperal
fever</i>. Volumes of literature had been written on the subject,
but as yet no one had deciphered its origin.</p>

<p>Now the whole scene has shifted; we know that the fever
is essentially a blood poison, a septic infection of the patient,
precisely similar to a wound infection anywhere else on the
body. The act of parturition causes wounds or abrasions;
these, then, place the woman in imminent danger of infection
of every sort, and it is this infection which it is now
possible to avoid. There is the greatest precaution necessary
on her part and on the part of her attendants, that she be
not contaminated by suspicious-looking finger nails, or dirty
hands, or soiled linen, or unhealthy and unclean surroundings.</p>

<p>The German Government has a compulsory law for a
system of antiseptic precautions, which is incumbent upon
all who attend lying-in women. The importance of a rule
to guide midwives and others in carrying out strictly antiseptic
measures was recognized in that country some ten
years ago, and the statistics show a remarkable diminution
of diseases peculiar to the childbed period. The sources of
these infectious micro-organisms are very different. They
may be derived from the body of another person, sick or
having died from an infectious disease, from suppurating
wounds and even from the secretions of healthy lying-in
patients. The patient or person herself may have improperly
bathed or neglected cleanliness and ablutions, but the
greatest danger arises from the neglected and unclean hands
and sleeves of the midwives and physicians, and from the
instruments usually employed under these circumstances,
like forceps, catheters, or the nozzle of a syringe. The law
above referred to requires all these instruments to be thoroughly
scalded, washed, and brushed every time they have
been used, and by such a complete system of disinfection,
the chances of infection are reduced to the minimum. I
hope some day our legislators will be wise enough to give us
similar laws.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">UNCLEANLINESS AS A CAUSE OF DISEASES IN
WOMEN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> custom of washing and bathing has existed from
the earliest times. Among the Egyptians it was a part of
their religious worship. Among the Jews it formed part of
the ceremony of purification prescribed by Moses. The
Greeks considered it a sanitary expedient, and among the
Romans it was instituted for similar purposes. All virtues
when carried to extremes degenerate into folly or vice, so
bathing in the days of the Roman Empire, became immoderate
and degenerated into enervating luxury and unbridled
debauchery, in which indiscriminate bathing of
both sexes was one of the demoralizing features.</p>

<p>The bath was usually taken after exercise and before
the principal meal, which rule holds good to-day, as the
very best and proper time. The gorgeous splendor of the
<i>Thermæ</i>, which was a palatial edifice constructed by Agrippa,
was adorned with beautiful statues and fine paintings,
while luxuriant green foliage of great variety formed enchanting
bowers of fairy splendor. This was thronged by
the Roman citizens for the pleasures of gymnastic exercises
and bathing.</p>

<p>In those countries which have adopted the religion of
the Arabian prophet, Mohammed, people bathe as a part of
their devotions, and a religion which has for a part of its
ritual the washing of the body, goes a great way towards
cleansing the spirit.</p>

<p>Among the Northern nations the introduction of the
bath dates back to the period of the Crusaders, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
<i>Tacitus</i> speaks of the river bathing of the Germans, which
was one of the strengthening methods employed by the
early Saxons. That filth and dirt generate crime and
moral depravity seems to be apparent, where squalid misery
has dulled the sensitiveness to unwholesome surroundings.</p>

<p>Sanitary science has also demonstrated that filth is the
most fruitful source of diseases that are called infectious,
because their origin is due to germs of the lowest forms of
vegetable life. The brightest page in the medical history
of the nineteenth century is that which records the discovery
of these micro-organisms as the cause of such diseases
as septicæmia or blood poisoning, pyæmia, diphtheria,
tuberculosis or consumption and others. All forms of fermentation
and putrefaction are due to the presence of some
germs, and upon this fact antiseptic surgery bases its scientific
premises.</p>

<p>The germ theory of disease, like every new discovery,
which supplants the accustomed and deeply-rooted theories
of the speculative philosophers, met with opposition,
criticism, ridicule and misconstruction, but the brilliant
achievements of Lister and Koch have established its founders
upon a pinnacle of fame, which promises to be an immortal
monument to their genius, and not only in surgery
has its beneficial influence been exerted, but the entire field
of medicine has been enriched by the germ theory, which
plays so formidable a part in the causation of many diseases.</p>

<p>The great boon that medical science will confer upon
humanity, in the future, will not be so much in improved
methods of treatment, as in the means and methods which
medical science will devise for preventing disease. One
ounce of prevention will always be worth a pound of cure.
When we look back fifteen or twenty years, we must even
now acknowledge that preventive medicine has accomplished
greater results than curative measures, because the
former can be made in the very nature of things <i>absolute</i>,
while curative agents are only relative. Puerperal, or childbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
fever, which is an <i>infectious disease</i>, was at times a pestilence,
which destroyed women by the score, in maternity
hospitals, or in certain neighborhoods, by the infection being
carried by midwives or accoucheurs from house to
house, yet no one had the least suspicion that it was possible
to carry the germs of this disease under the fingernails
of the attendant, or on the clothing or a syringe, or on
some other little instrument, from one patient to another, and,
indeed, there are a great many to-day who are practicing midwifery
who are still ignorant of the importance of refined
cleanliness.</p>

<p>But for this ignorance, there is no longer an excuse, because
the infectiousness of this and other diseases is so positively
established, and even the physical characteristics of
the micro-organisms have become familiar to the microscopists.
This knowledge of the causation of puerperal
fever has been applied to the employment of preventive
measures, so that this dreadful malady is becoming a rarity,
particularly in countries where scrupulous care and cleanliness
are enforced by governmental rules and regulations.
I refer to this particular <i>fever</i>, because it is, to my mind, one
of the most brilliant illustrations of the efficacy of preventive
or antiseptic medicine.</p>

<p>There is a gynecological hygiene with which women
should become familiar; it is based on the principle of antiseptic
precautions applied to the daily lives of their sex.
The object of this is to keep the body and reproductive organs
that are exposed to contamination or infection from
the outer world in the most refined and scrupulous cleanliness.
The vaginal douche or syringe is as important an
auxiliary to a refined woman’s toilet case as her tooth
brush, because the cleanliness of the genitals is as essential
to the preservation of health and comfort, as the possession
of a sweet breath and the preservation of the teeth. I am
therefore convinced of the hygienic value of familiarizing
little children with washing or sponging their external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
genitals; in a few years this will have become second nature,
and they are thus protected for all future time from contracting
diseases which have their origin in personal uncleanness.
It behooves mothers to avoid all delicacy on
this subject, so that their little ones may grow up with the
sentiment that to the pure in heart all things are pure.
It is false modesty and ignorance which degenerate into
vice and excesses; the scientific truth is always pure and
holy, because it is based on reason, while abnormal delicacy
is only emotional, and is quite likely to shoot into the other
extreme, namely, licentiousness.</p>

<p>As the world grows wiser, the physiology of the reproductive
organs should form a part of its wisdom, and in proportion
to this knowledge, will their functions become questions
of sense, instead of sentiment and nonsense.</p>

<p>The vagina is a membranous canal. It is situated in the
cavity of the pelvis, below and behind the bladder, and in
front and above the rectum. Its direction is curved from
before backwards and a little upwards; its walls are flattened
and ordinarily in contact with each other. Its length is
about four inches along its anterior wall, and an inch or two
longer along its posterior wall. In introducing a nozzle of
a syringe it must always be remembered, that the tube is to
be introduced directly backward on a horizontal plane with
the body in the erect posture; by attempting to introduce it
directly upwards, you meet with resistance from the anterior
wall of the vagina.</p>

<p>In this cavity the secretion is susceptible of decomposition,
owing to the accessibility of air laden with germs,
which excite fermentation. A day or two after the cessation
of the menstrual flow, there still lingers a little blood in the
cavity of the vagina; this becoming infected with the germs
in the vagina, a decomposition is the result, which is recognized
by an offensive smell. The naturally soothing and
harmless secretion is now changed into an acrid, irritating
fluid, which not only may cause an inflammation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
membrane of the vagina, but also excoriate the skin at the
orifice of the canal.</p>

<p>Leucorrhœa, or what is commonly called <i>whites</i>, is the
most distressing symptom of this condition. In the course
of months or in some instances a few years, the inflammation
spreads from the vagina to the mouth and lining membrane
of the uterus. Inflammation of the endometrium or
lining of the womb will excite another complication, the so-called
ulceration, but more correctly termed <i>erosion</i>. Who
will deny the usefulness of any advice that will teach girls
or women to avoid all these diseases? It is all contained in
the simple phrase, <i>Keep clean</i>. Young girls must be taught by
their mothers or guardians, not only the necessity of keeping
the external genitals clean by daily ablutions, but a few
days after menstruation, upon the slightest indication of
offensiveness, she must resort to the employment of the vaginal
douche or syringe, so as to wash out the seeds of disease,
that are rapidly multiplying themselves, and if allowed
to remain will entail the consequences to which I
have already referred.</p>

<p>As an antiseptic wash, there is nothing so simple, efficacious
and healing, as a solution of borax in previously
boiled water, that has been allowed to cool to the proper
temperature, which is between 103 and 106 degrees Fahr.,
one teaspoonful of the powdered article to the half gallon
of water, to be used as a rinsing for each time.</p>

<p>Directions for administering vaginal douches will be
given elsewhere. The proper time of the day for the employment
of the wash is always at bedtime; and once or
twice a week is quite often enough in the majority of instances.</p>

<p>Married women are more exposed to infectious contamination
than single ones, because they are constantly liable
to have infectious microbes introduced into the vagina during
the ordinary course of marital relations. Men, as a
rule, are neither cleanly nor careful in their habits, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
approach their wives without any thought of serious consequences
in their sexual relations. I had a married
woman under treatment for an offensive discharge from
her vagina which I traced to her husband, thence to a suppurating
wound on his horse, which the husband had under
his treatment. This can happen, of course, only through
carelessness. By getting some of the matter or pus on the
fingers, which incidentally contaminates his person, or not
washing and brushing the finger nails, the husband may
directly convey the infection to his wife, and thus inaugurate,
unconsciously, an inflammation of the vagina, which becomes
complicated, as the primary disease is neglected, leading to
inflammation of the womb and ovaries, and often to abscesses,
that compromise not only the health but the life of
the sufferer.</p>

<p>To preclude the possibility of <i>innocent</i> infection, between
husband and wife, there is only one means of prevention,
and that is a careful <i>toilet</i>, which thoroughly cleanses the
bodies in general and the genitals in particular.</p>

<p>Another fruitful source of disease of women, in this country
and to an alarming extent in Europe, to which the elder
Martin of Berlin called the attention of the profession over
thirty years ago, is the specific or gonorrhœal infection of
wives by their unfaithful husbands. The number of poor
women whose health has been irretrievably ruined, by their
husbands having had illicit relations with lewd, diseased
women, is only known to those who have made this class of
diseases a special object of inquiry. I have nothing to do with
the moral aspect of this question, but only with the physical
suffering that such men inflict upon their innocent wives
and the mothers of their children, for the brief indulgence
of libidinous pleasure. To think that any man would take
the chances of making his wife a suffering and perhaps incurable
invalid, just for the purpose of gratifying temporary
animal passions, is to place him beneath the brute creation,
which has not the intelligence to reason on the fearful consequences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
No man who has been guilty of illicit relations
should return to his wife until seven days have elapsed, and
even not then until he has repeatedly washed himself by
means of a syringe with some cleansing or disinfecting fluid,
like borax water, or, what is preferable, a weak solution of
the bichloride of mercury.</p>

<p>The wife and mother who entertains the slightest suspicion,
must insist upon these precautions, and then not
neglect to thoroughly wash and cleanse herself in the manner
previously referred to. It is the height of hypocrisy
to be mealy mouthed on this subject; the wives and mothers
who are fortunate to have husbands beyond suspicion,
should learn that some of their sisters have dangers to encounter
and heartaches to suffer, with which their own lives
are not marred, but perhaps the lives of their daughters may
be; for the unhappy woman who becomes the wife of the
blear-eyed sensualist, there is only one relief, and that is education
in these subjects.</p>

<p>I know of no disease in which a correct and early diagnosis
or recognition is of greater importance to avoid the
frightful consequence and serious complications, than this
one. It begins with a mild vaginal catarrh, which, when it
is as yet locally confined to the vagina, can be easily cured.
In course of time it spreads itself along the vaginal tract to
the cavity of the womb. When it gets there, the treatment
becomes more complicated, and for this reason; in order
to reach the disease now, the cavity of the womb must
be dilated, and this is an operation which the average
physician can only accomplish in a bungling and imperfect
manner. But even in this stage of the disease, in the hands
of a skillful physician, the course of the disease can be
checked and the patient readily cured. When the disease
gets beyond the womb, when it invades the Fallopian tubes
and the ovaries, the picture has entirely changed.</p>

<p>The organs affected are then inaccessible to local treatment,
so that the disease invariably continues until the organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
are more or less destroyed by inflammation, which
results in the tissues breaking down into an abscess. In
this stage of the disease it has become quite the fashion to
operate in this class of cases, offering as an excuse a sure
and speedy cure. Here I would interpose a word of warning
to sufferers belonging to this class, not to be too willing
to comply with surgical methods, because I know from careful
observations, that promises of this nature end often
in disappointment and death, while an intelligent conservative
treatment can only disappoint but never kill, and with
patience and perseverance in the application of electricity
and hygienic rules of health, a cure is almost certain. The
sick in body and mind are often beguiled into operations of
a very serious nature, which are entirely unnecessary, because
better results can be accomplished by other methods
of cure, in which the possibility of a fatal termination is
excluded.</p>

<p>Some women feel tired and languid from morning until
night; they feel as tired in the morning when they get up
as they were in the evening when they retired. If we
tell them that it is entirely due to negligence of their own
persons in not using vaginal washings regularly, they will
undoubtedly feel surprised. In the great majority of these
cases, this is owing to putrefactive changes going on in the
cavity of the vagina. In the process of fermentative decomposition,
the so-called <i>ptomaines</i> are developed; these are
chemical poisons, which are absorbed into the blood, and
by their depressing influences on the nervous system are
the cause of the weakness and tired feeling. There are no
remedies which, when taken into the stomach, will do the
slightest good for this condition, and it is a waste of both
time and money to expect relief from drugs.</p>

<p>This can easily be remedied by cleanliness, so that the
secretions are not long enough retained in the vagina, to
decompose and develop these ptomaine poisons.</p>

<p>During and after confinement is another important time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
for the employment of vaginal washes. The <i>lochial discharge</i>,
which is one of the ordinary accompaniments of the newly-delivered
woman, is a discharge from the uterus, which continues
for several days, growing less and less, for a few
weeks, when, in a normally healthy state of affairs, it should
cease entirely. The lochia is the oozing from the mouths
of the blood-vessels of the womb where the placenta or afterbirth
was attached, together with the passing off of the old
lining membrane of the womb, while the organ is returning
to its original condition. At first the discharge is bloody,
and it may retain this character for two or more days after
delivery; then the color is changed, partaking more or less
of a watery nature and presenting a yellowish hue; it then becomes
whitish and ultimately ceases altogether. After the
first four or five days the lochial discharge often becomes very
offensive; this is a sign of putrescence or decomposition, and
the only remedy in this, as in all other similar instances, is
to wash the vagina thoroughly with borax water, or with a
preparation for which a prescription will be given further
on.</p>

<p>In every case of delivery, the mouth of the womb is more
or less torn or lacerated; this is unavoidable, and it is generally
harmless. One of the surgical humbugs is to sew or stitch,
or attempt to stitch, these little harmless tears together, not
of course for the good it will do the patient, because she is
more likely to be injured by this meddlesome surgery, but
to make a business and a fee. The common practice of these
and kindred surgical expedients is one of the crying evils of
an overcrowded profession which is trying to keep itself employed
at all hazards.</p>

<p>The vagina also receives more or less injury during an
ordinary confinement; if the midwife or the doctor is too
meddlesome or in too big a hurry to get through, he will
use the forceps, which simply means, to pull the child out
and through the vagina, before nature has had time to
dilate or stretch the parts sufficiently, to allow the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to pass through the maternal organs without injuring them.
As a result of this brutal haste, frightful lacerations are incurred,
which require immediate attention, but small lacerations
heal without any further treatment than to keep clean.</p>

<p>After every confinement there is considerable sore or
raw surface, with which the offensive discharge comes in
contact, to become readily absorbed or taken up into the
system, giving rise to fevers or inflammations of the womb
and other pelvic organs. If one has a wound on any part
of the body, the first thought would, or rather should, be to
keep it clean; exactly the same treatment is required for
wounds of the womb and vagina.</p>

<p>When the discharge becomes offensive, it also becomes
dangerous and poisonous, and the only and proper thing to
do is to thoroughly wash out the entire vaginal cavity until
all offensive smell has disappeared. The only sure sign
that anyone can have of the completeness and thoroughness
of the vaginal washings, is that there is no longer any
fetid or offensive smell perceptible.</p>

<p>It requires no particularly trained nurse or expert to
administer a cleansing vaginal injection, yet it is more
likely to be done in a bungling, inefficient manner than in
a proper workmanlike manner; for this reason, it would
be well to remember a few of the necessary details of carrying
out the douching. In the first place, the room in which
the vaginal douche is administered must be comfortably
warm, so as to preclude the possibility of chilling the
patient; the windows or any other opening liable to cause
draft must be closed. The nozzle of the syringe, whether it
be a fountain or a family syringe, must have been thoroughly
brushed and cleansed with soap water, before and
after each use; if the instrument is old, or has been used for
questionable purposes, or, perchance, made the rounds of the
neighborhood, it had better be thrown into the ash barrel, and
an entirely new syringe, the “Alpha,” be employed, which,
by its sure and continuous stream, I consider the most suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
female syringe. The bulb of a syringe must be compressed
in the palm of the hand slowly and deliberately.</p>

<p>The position of the patient is of considerable importance;
a vessel is placed under her, which is carefully adjusted,
so as not to tip too far backwards, otherwise it will overflow
and drench the bed or the patient’s clothing. Beneath the
small of her back a few extra pillows are placed, and thus
she comfortably reclines on her back, while the attendant
manages the disinfecting wash and syringe, placed in a
basin between her thighs. Half a gallon of the fluid is
usually sufficient. The temperature of the wash is very important
and may range between 103 and 106 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>The recumbent position is only intended for women
who are confined to their beds; others, who are around and
about on their feet, can sit comfortably over a chamber, on
the edge of a low chair, having the vessel underneath them,
and the wash of course in a separate basin. In the course
of my experience I have been called to mothers, five to eight
days after delivery, who were in a raging fever, presumably
from the ptomaines which had developed in the vagina and
poisoned the blood. After a few vaginal injections, sometimes
after the first, the fever subsided entirely. These remarkable
results we owe to the <i>antiseptic</i> treatment of disease,
and when it once becomes generally known that this
is only another word for cleanliness, infectious diseases will
grow correspondingly less, and the cure for those that exist
will be less experimental and more reliable.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">MARITAL EXCESSES AND PREVENTION OF
CONCEPTION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a previous chapter, the physiology of conception was
explained, and it was shown to be an organic function, independent
of and remote from the sexual act, and over which
the parties to the act have no control. From this scientific
statement of the actual fact, it becomes at once apparent that
conception or pregnancy may result without natural sexual
congress, by simply injecting the sperm of the male, by
means of a uterine syringe, into the womb of the female,
while she is in a state of unconsciousness. It is also quite
probable that a criminal conspiracy of this nature could
be carried out, without any violation to the delicate anatomy
that is involved in the natural process; a detailed
account of all the probabilities which the ingenuity of a
scientifically-trained mind could devise, belongs more properly
to the department of medical jurisprudence. It is, however,
of sufficient general importance that the reader should
have at least an idea of the door that has been unlocked
through physiological researches.</p>

<p>What we are at present endeavoring to make clear is,
the great distinction and difference between <i>coition</i> and fecundation
or conception; while one is but the result of the
natural instinct aroused by the senses, the other reaches out
into the realm of the Creator. When man undertakes to
destroy the product of conception, he has interfered with
the prerogative of God and is guilty of murder.</p>

<p>The question may now naturally arise in the minds of
pure and morally-disposed persons, whether there is any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
time, without doing violence to God’s law, that the children
of men have the moral right to control, or regulate, the procreation
of the human race? If I answer the question in
the affirmative, I will then proceed to inquire into the ways
and means to that end, and also into the pernicious methods
that are employed, to accomplish this result.</p>

<p>It is true, that the Divine command was to be fruitful
and multiply, but before this command was given, man was
a free agent and a reasoning being, which implies that he is
after all to be the judge as to the degree in which this command
is to be carried out. That is, that there are mitigating
and qualifying circumstances, which man has not only a
right to consider, but which he is expected to take into
account in propagating the species, by virtue of his reasoning
faculties.</p>

<p>If this command were absolute and universal, chaste
celibacy would be a cardinal sin, yet it has always been held
by the canons of spiritual growth and morality, to be a Divine
virtue, and even the loving Jesus knew not woman, because
the forces that are thus expended will exert their
power in other directions and towards developing powers of
a higher order.</p>

<p>I believe that a moral code, which is too exacting to be
observed by the average person, fails to accomplish the restraint
or reform that is desired, so that, after all, it becomes
essential to lay down such rules as the average men or
women can follow as guides for their actions. A reformer,
who starts out with the broad declaration that it is immoral
to take human life, and a murderous act to destroy a
half-formed human being in its mother’s womb, and that it
is equally murderous to prevent the recent products of the
sexual act from becoming a viable being, fails to make the
impression he desires. The first half of the proposition neutralizes
the second of its sacred essence, in placing on the
same level the organic function of conception and the animal
function of the sexual act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>This view is so manifestly absurd to the person of even
ordinary perception, that I feel assured, that it would neither
lessen feticide nor sexual excess.</p>

<p>Spermatozoa on the one hand, and the ova of the female
on the other, are, even in the natural and uninterrupted
course of nature, destined for destruction, for whenever the
female menstruates, these ova are discharged, and whenever
the male copulates, hundreds of spermatozoa are found
swimming in the spermatic fluid, which in case there be no
ripened ovum are nothing more than so much waste secretion.
Both are a means to an end, and that end is the
reproduction of the species. It appears to me a flight of
fancy, from the sublime to the ridiculous, to assign to the
sexual act the same importance as to the passive function of
conception, and I believe that doctrines of this nature lack
not only the least scientific support, but weaken any argument
in favor of the moral or spiritual aspect, which alone
raises the question of feticide from a social evil to a mortal
sin.</p>

<p>Man is prompted by a powerful instinctive desire for the
use of the sexual organs, that draws him involuntarily to
the opposite sex, not for the continuance of the race, because
the passion arises much oftener without the remotest
thoughts of any fruitful results. I have the greatest regard
for the life of the unborn child, yet I am far from agreeing
with those who would stamp as libidinous every thought of
the sexual instinct, that has not as its stimulus the procreation
of the species. While the average man is in the
flesh, he is an animal man, and there is no use of trying to
make a spiritual saint out of flesh and blood, and when we
do find that, we have a very exceptional and remarkable
person. But what, as reasonable beings, we should do, is to
bridle the animal passions with moral reins, so that we can
stand up, in full-statured manhood, with the respectful approval
of our own conscience, able to rise above the mere
animal appetites, to the dignity of reasonable beings. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
instinct, like other propensities, is excited by sensations, and
these may originate either in the sexual organs themselves,
or may be excited through the organs of special sense. In
man the passion is most powerfully aroused by impressions
conveyed through the sight or the touch. It often happens
that localized sensations will excite the sexual desire of either
sex, so that many cases of excessive sexual desire can be
traced to some local disease of the genital apparatus: chief
among the numerous causes that may be cited, is pruritus or
local itch, erythema and active congestion of the womb and
ovaries.</p>

<p>“This tendency cannot be regarded,” says Dr. Carpenter,
“as a simple passion or emotion, since it is the result of
the combined operations of the reason, the imagination, and
the moral feelings: it is in this engraftment of the physical
or spiritual attachment upon the more corporeal instinct,
that a difference exists between the sexual relations of man
and those of the lower animals. In proportion as the human
being makes the temporary gratification of the mere sexual
appetites his chief object, and overlooks the happiness arising
from spiritual communion, which is not only purer but
more permanent, and of which a renewal may be anticipated
in another world,&mdash;does he degrade himself to a level with
the brutes that perish. Yet how lamentably frequent is this
degradation.” This quotation gives the entire physical and
spiritual aspect of the question, by one of the most eminent
physiologists of our time, so that in the natural course of our
investigation we are led to inquire into the currents of
thought, which would tend towards developing <i>moral restraint</i>.</p>

<p>Moral restraint means the restraint of the animal man by
his spiritual or higher self; the <i>will</i> must possess its due predominance
to exercise its determining power in curbing the
passions of the one, and directing the course of the thought
in the other.</p>

<p>The cold, calculating materialist, whose ideal is circumscribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
by the laws that have been deduced from the phenomena
of the material world, can scarcely appreciate the
higher sentiments that are involved in this investigation,
unless he becomes changed in thought and feeling to the
things that are about him. To accomplish this result is
hardly within the scope of this work. With the average
man as we find him, my observation has taught me that it
makes, after all, little difference, whether he believes in a
spiritual nature or is avowedly materialistic. The great
majority of men and women live, so to say, in the turbulent
waters of their own passions, wafted hither and thither by
the impulses of emotional excitement and instinctive desires.
There is little or no hope for reform, if they have not
sufficient force of character to cry halt, and stop to think
a little upon questions which are to them of the greatest
importance.</p>

<p>Marital excesses are the mainspring of so much disease,
that ordinarily is attributed to quite different causes, that
this chapter would be very deficient were I to omit to call
the attention of my readers to this fact. The men on the
whole are oftener the victims of the ill effects of unbridled
lust than the women, which shows itself by violent and uncontrollable
temper, in the one case, and stupid docility in
the other: by a lean, hungry, nervous appearance, or a brutish,
sanguineous obesity; extremes of the different temperaments
and habits are but the natural outgrowth of the constitution
inherent in each individual case.</p>

<p>Women, as a rule, are more passive, less amorous and
more chaste in thought and feeling than men, and if we
define emotion as an <i>idea</i> associated with pleasurable or
painful feelings, women are, as far as appertains to their
sexual nature, contrary to the generally-accepted opinion,
much less <i>emotional</i> than men. Continence, among the
unmarried women, is the rule, while among the men it is
the rare exception; this is because her <i>will</i> is by nature
stronger, while her <i>reason</i> is weaker, she intuitively arrives
at conclusions that are her guide and saviour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a prevalent idea among men that the marriage ceremony
removes all restraint from the exercise of the sexual
function; this not only neutralizes and destroys all sentiment
of true love, which seeks for the happiness of the object it
loves, but breeds hatred and contempt. To be permanently
happy and mutually respectful, there must be love beyond
the pleasure of gratifying the mere sexual instinct, there
must be love in the realm of thought and a spiritual communion
above the instincts of the flesh.</p>

<p>“Any warning against sexual dangers,” says Dr. Acton,
“would be very incomplete if it did not extend to the excesses
so often committed by married persons in ignorance
of their ill effects. Too frequent emissions of the seminal
fluid, and too frequent excitement of the nervous system, are
in themselves most destructive. The result is the same
within the marriage bond as without it. The married man
and woman who think that because they are married, they
can commit no excesses, however often the act of sexual congress
is repeated, will suffer as certainly and as seriously as
the unmarried debauchee, who acts on the same principle in
his indulgences&mdash;perhaps more certainly, from their very
ignorance, and from their not taking those precautions and
following those rules which a career of vice is apt to teach
the sensualist. Many a man has, until his marriage, lived a
most continent life; so has his wife. As soon as they are
wedded, intercourse is indulged in night after night, neither
party having an idea that these repeated sexual acts are excesses
which the system of neither can bear, and which to
the man, at least, is absolute ruin and to the woman a source
of disease. The practice is continued till health is impaired,
sometimes permanently, and when a patient is at last obliged
to seek medical advice, he is thunderstruck at learning that
his sufferings arise from excesses unwittingly committed.
Married people appear to think that connection may be repeated
as regularly and almost as often as their meals. Till
they are told of their danger, the idea never enters their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
heads that they are guilty of great and almost criminal excess;
nor is this to be wondered at, since the possibility of
such a cause of disease is seldom hinted at by the medical
man they consult. Some go so far as to believe that indulgence
may increase these powers, just as gymnastic exercises
augment the force of the muscles. This is a popular
error, and requires correction. Such patients should be
told that the shock to the system, each time connection is
indulged in, is very powerful, and that the expenditure of
seminal fluid must be particularly injurious to organs previously
debilitated. It is by this and similar excesses that
premature old age and complaints of the generative organs
are brought on.”</p>

<p>Wives of men of great vital force are not long before
they become delicate, sickly and nervous, and, entirely ignorant
of the real cause Of their feebleness, seek relief by taking
“a good iron tonic,” which does them about as much
good as if they had left it alone, the tonic effect of iron
being entirely overestimated, but the delusion is created by
associating the word iron with the idea strength. After the
different <i>tonics</i> have been tried, the patient consults a physician,
who, on general principles and after a hasty examination,
informs her that she has “womb disease.” These two
words for the time being settle the question; she now begins
“to doctor,” and from the general or family doctor she
finds her way to the <i>female</i> specialists, who, as a rule, belong
to the recognized magnifiers and humbugs of the day.
Here she becomes one of the regular habitues of the specialist’s
waiting room, disappointed and not a little discouraged.
She makes the rounds of the most prominent of them, until
she has been doctored out of her dear patience and her still
dearer money. Hope is often a forlorn consolation, and if
by chance she now takes a trip to the country or undertakes
a long visit at some distance, to her folks, which gives the
poor woman respite from the “marital rights” of her Lord
and Master, she recovers her former health, strength and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
buoyancy. Of course everybody congratulates her upon
the wonderful effect of the climate, when the climate had no
more to do with her recovery than the moon. The remarkable
change was owing to having been let alone by
husband and doctor.</p>

<p>That the attempt to call attention to these flagrant abuses
of the dishonesty and ignorance of the one and the blind
animal instinct of the other will be decried and stigmatized as
“cranky,” I know beforehand, but I know also, that those who
criticise these sentiments are fully convinced of the truth
of the statement. The diseases that belong to this class
are, like most uterine diseases, of an inflammatory nature,
and for that reason <i>rest</i> is one of the most essential features
in the treatment. But as this class belongs to the avoidable
causes, prevention is much better than cure. I therefore
advise, as of first importance, to abandon the American
custom of man and wife occupying the same bed, which is
only customary among the poorer classes of Europe, who cannot
afford to have separate beds or chambers. The advantage
of the European custom in segregating one’s self on
retirement, to avoid the sexual instincts being unduly excited,
can be borne out by remembering the physiology of the
instinct, which we were told is excited by sight and feeling.
Besides these, there is the possible undue familiarity, which
the joint occupancy of the chamber or bed of man and wife
may engender, and that, too, is likely to lead to excessive relations.</p>

<p>All efforts to exercise voluntary control, by prolonging
the sexual act or extending the venereal orgasm, are fraught
with the most pernicious results to the nerves, terminating
in a partial or complete paralysis of the different organs
of the body, or a low grade of inflammation is excited,
which offers a fruitful soil for the development of various
diseases.</p>

<p>A man who has become the husband of a woman should
never cease to be a gentleman on that account, nor should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he become lost to a consideration of those delicacies of refinement,
which smooth the common relations in the exercise
of daily duties.</p>

<p>Continence is the complete restraint from sexual indulgence,
which in its fullest sense does not apply to the
married state, but it comes within the scope of every married
life to cultivate and practice it as one of its virtues.
Every married couple should be continent for days and
weeks at a time, and when one or the other is not feeling
well, abstinence should be practiced, as the rule, not only to
avoid a nervous shock, which may have serious results, but
because conception in an abnormal physical condition, will
perpetuate itself in the child, which is quite likely to inherit
a nervous or sickly constitution. When pregnancy supervenes,
undue sexual excitement of the mother often has the
most serious consequences to the fetus, and may result in
its death, or induce abortion.</p>

<p>Diet is to be regulated, to assist a firm determination
to lead a chaste and purer life. Stimulating and highly-seasoned
food, and alcoholic beverages, are not to be used, because
they increase the circulation of the blood and stimulate
the nerves to inflammatory activity. Meat should be
eaten only once a day, and the supper should be bland and
light.</p>

<p>Nature has set a time during which continence should be
practiced for the purpose of preserving the health and controlling
the reproductive function, that is, the menstrual
period. Menstruation in women corresponds to the ripening
and discharge of the human ovule. The aptitude for
impregnation is a day or two before and six to eight days
after the courses cease. This is a rule which applies to the
great majority of women, and if the sexual relations are suspended
from a few days before the onset of the menses until
six or eight days after the flow has ceased, the chances for
pregnancy are reduced to the minimum. This physiological
relation of the organic function of conception to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the sexual act is to be recommended as the most wholesome
check to reproduction in early married life, although I believe
that there is no time better calculated to raise a family
than while you are young and hopeful.</p>

<p>Children are common objects of love and hope for both
parents. Life and health are ever changing the relations of
our surroundings, and when newly-married people put off
to the dim future the hopes of rearing a family, they are
often doomed to everlasting disappointment. Nature is capricious
and jealous of her prerogatives, and those who trifle
with her functions must expect to be frustrated in the end,
and have no one but themselves to blame if she fails to respond
to their capricious wishes. Children make trouble of
course, so were we as troublesome in our time, but there is
also a great deal of pleasure in watching them grow from
day to day in bodily strength and mental perception, which
no amount of selfish enjoyment can compensate.</p>

<p>The diseases that are brought upon women by the different
practices and mechanical devices to prevent conception
are too numerous to mention in a work of this character.
Some of the methods are absolutely loathesome to all sense
of decency and reduce sexual intercourse much below the
instinctive indulgence of the brute; these debauches of the
conjugal bed not only sap the vitality of the participants,
but must lower or destroy all mutual respect, and ultimate
in dissension and strife, which the divorce court will finally
assuage.</p>

<p>Referring to the practice of conjugal onanism or interrupted
or incomplete coitus, Dr. Franklin Devay says:
“However, it is not difficult to conceive the degree of perturbation
that a like practice should exert upon the genital
system of woman by provoking desires which are not gratified;
a profound stimulation is felt through the entire apparatus;
the uterus, Fallopian tubes and ovaries enter into a state of
orgasm, a storm which is not appeased by the natural crisis; a
nervous super-excitation persists. There occurs, then, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
would take place if, presenting food to a famished man, one
should snatch it from his mouth after having thus violently
excited his appetite. The sensibilities of the womb and the
entire reproductive system are teased for no purpose. It is
to this cause, too often repeated, that we should attribute the
multiple <i>neuroses</i>, those strange affections which originate in
the genital system of women. Our conviction respecting
them is based upon a great number of observations. Furthermore,
the normal relations existing between the married
couple undergo unfortunate changes; this affection, formed
upon reciprocal esteem, is little by little effaced by the repetition
of an act which pollutes the marriage bed; from thence
proceed certain hard feelings, certain deep impressions, which,
gradually growing, eventuate in the scandalous ruptures of
which the community rarely know the real motive.” This
is in every respect as hurtful as the vicious practice of
solitary vice, although that is comparatively less common
among young virgins than among those of the opposite sex.
Nevertheless, this is a frequent cause of hysterical symptoms
and uterine disease. Stop it at once; there is no burden that
a large family of children can impose upon you, be it even
poverty and want, as great as the inevitable results of these
unnatural habits.</p>

<p>The use of caps or tissue coverings, made of thin rubber
or gold-beater’s skin, are not only suggestive of the licentiousness
of the brothel but their employment causes physical lesions
from their irritating friction to the walls of the vagina.
I have had under my treatment obstinate ulcerations of the
vagina which were due to their use, and in one instance it
degenerated into cancer. The use of the “womb veil,” which
originated in France, has been denounced as a fruitful source
of ulceration of the womb, by modern French writers, who
are more familiar with their indiscriminate employment
than Americans. There has been also a plug or stem pessary
employed for the purpose “of sealing up the womb,”
which is partly introduced into the mouth and cervical canal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of the organ; this obviously adds insult to injury, by also
irritating the cavity of the womb and exciting inflammation
of its lining membrane. There are other devices for
a similar purpose, that have the same tendency of irritating
and wounding the genitals of the female.</p>

<p>There is nothing that could be said, to intimidate some
women, by forewarning them of the danger of their preventive
measures; they will continue to make business for the
specialists, and drain the purses of their husbands, but there
is a great majority of good, noble, matronly women who are
pure in heart and mind, that appreciate the value of the information
that I impart. What I desire to further suggest,
is a preventive measure that is entirely harmless and consistent
with chastity and cleanliness, for I believe that within
certain bounds, a woman has a moral right to limit or control
the conception of her womb. But right here the option
ceases. If she pushes her measures beyond the portals of
the womb, if she employs medicines or mechanical devices
to bring around her courses, when she suspects pregnancy
or conception, she becomes a murderess in the eyes of the
Creator. The bowl of tanzy tea, or any of the many quack
nostrums, advertised in the public prints, are as much an
instrument of murder as the <i>probe</i> of the abortionist. It would
be the height of sophistry to make a distinction between the
embryo of an hour or a day old, and that of any future
period. The potentiality of a human being is established
at the moment of conception, and the destruction of this, at
any period, is homicide. No one can deny less importance
to the cause, which is conception, than to the effect, which is
the human embryo, for without the one, the other is impossible.</p>

<p>Hence, not to bear a child implies not to conceive a
child, for if once conceived, it must be born.</p>

<p>The reasons that may exist for limiting the progeny of
each particular pair cannot be formulated into a code, for
these are questions of conscience, between the individuals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
their Creator, on the one hand, and on the other, they should
be influenced by economic conditions and physical or constitutional
taints of the progenitors. I do not believe in the
truth of the law of Malthus, that there is a tendency for
population to increase faster than the means of subsistence,
but I am inclined to the view held by John Stuart Mill, that
“no one has a right to bring children into life to be supported
by other people.” But when the same eminent authority
designates the procreative act as brute instinct, I
think he is in great error, for that is not so. Conjugal affection
and the sentiment of love spring from the reproductive
systems, through the reflex action of the brain, and these
have their moral significance, and should not be branded as
brutal, for upon their normal functions depends the perpetuation
of the race, and as it was so ordained by the Creator,
it cannot be an unholy passion.</p>

<p>To be physically strong and well are the prerequisites
for happiness, and if we cannot transmit to our offspring this
essential quality, it would be much better for society if we
were not instrumental in bringing defective children into
the world. The competitive struggle for existence is hard
enough for the vigorous and robust; how much greater
must it be for the constitutionally infirm? When these conditions
of infirmity exist, they should influence our course as
progenitors; this appears to me self-evident, and I trust in
the wisdom that is innate to the human soul, that only the
best ends will be subserved.</p>

<p>An expedient that is to accomplish the object in view,
must be in the nature of a wholesome sanitary measure,
that violates no law of nature. The inordinate use of any
preventive, coupled with excessive indulgence, cannot be
without ill effects. Excesses must be studiously avoided, so
as not to incur the diseases of which mention has already
been made. The employment of a vaginal douche of the
proper temperature, medicated with a little pure alcohol, is
not injurious and is the most reliable of all preventives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
provided it is intelligently used and without delay. The
quantity of fluid to be used is a <i>quart</i> of warm water, of
103 to 105 degrees Fahr., to which two tablespoonfuls of
alcohol is added; of this, three-fourths or all is to be douched
through the vagina.</p>

<p>The vaginal irrigation is to be undertaken immediately
after the act; if sufficient time is allowed to pass, the spermatozoa
will have entered the mouth of the womb; then
they are clearly beyond the reach of the wash. The warm
water and the necessary paraphernalia are to be held in
readiness so as to lose no time in making the toilet, nor
should there be unnecessary exposure to the danger of catching
cold. The nozzle of the syringe should always be of
hard rubber, because that is not likely to rust or corrode.
The syringe is to be kept scrupulously clean by means of
occasional brushings in soapy water. Vaginal injections
should never be taken in the morning, if the person is required
to exercise on her feet, and for the same reason,
should any husband have marital relations with his wife
before rising in the morning, the wife is likely to suffer
all day, either by soreness or pain or by a dragging sensation
of the womb and vagina.</p>

<p>The same rule is to be followed in vaginal irrigation as
for other purposes, the main point being to throw the fluid
well up into the vagina, and that can only be done if the
nozzle is carried directly backward and not upwards. No
violence or force is to be used, under any circumstance.</p>

<p class="pch">CRIMINAL ABORTION OR FETICIDE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> so far endeavored to give a cursory description of
<i>avoidable</i> causes, which were inadvertantly or thoughtlessly
encouraged, and it is to be hoped that my friendly reproof
and counsel will incite my readers to modify their pernicious
habits and direct the currents of their thoughts into channels
more or less in harmony with the hygiene that I have
been at liberty to suggest.</p>

<p>There are few persons, if any, who would voluntarily act
and think in a manner that would be prejudicial to their
physical or moral welfare, if they were educated to a standard
of knowledge that gave them an insight into the evil
consequences. The law of <i>self-preservation</i> is innate in our
natures, so that we are ready to cultivate the good and useful
and shun that which may do harm.</p>

<p>Among the avoidable causes there is none so prolific of
disease as that which is traced to the premature expulsion
of the ovum or fetus from the mother’s womb.</p>

<p>This appears self-evident, when we stop to consider that
the function of reproduction is at once by far the most complicated
of the physiological processes of the female economy,
so that its sudden interruption will naturally induce any one
or all of the physical or pelvic ailments which we are called
upon to discuss.</p>

<p>For our purpose it will not be sufficient to consider the
subject from a medical standpoint alone, because the thoughts
drift involuntarily, as it were, from the physical into the
metaphysical, from the material into the spiritual part of
our nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not within the scope of this work to enter upon an
inquiry into the scientific evidence of the existence of the
soul or advance any argument whatever in support of that
doctrine, but I assume the existence of an immortal soul to
be a fact.</p>

<p>What I will endeavor to explain is when and where this
mystic union of the soul with the body takes place? Here
the speculations of the medical philosophers have been contradictory,
on account of attributing to the fetus different
kinds of life, that is, an organic or vegetating existence attached
to the mother’s womb, and as such not possessed of
sentient principle, until the real or spiritual life imbues the
fetus, when it becomes a living soul.</p>

<p>Hippocrates, the most famous physician of antiquity,
who, even in the light of the nineteenth century, looms up as
one of the most brilliant intellects that the world ever had,
lent the weight of his judgment to this very unreasonable
doctrine.</p>

<p>He supposed that animation occurred from thirty to
forty-two days after conception.</p>

<p>The Stoics went still further and maintained that there
was no vitality until after birth and the establishment of respiration.</p>

<p>The Academicians were of the opinion, that life was imparted
to the fetus during the period in which the mother
carried it in the womb, but they could not agree on the time
when it began. Even the Roman Church, which, in the main,
is right on this question, speaks of <i>animate</i> and <i>inanimate</i>
fetuses. When it is remembered that there was no scientific
physiology upon which the ancients based their opinions,
it is not at all surprising that, in the light of modern research,
they are shown to be all wrong.</p>

<p>There is no time during the child’s sojourn in the mother’s
womb that life is less active than at another, and any opinion
to the contrary is manifestly absurd and unscientific.</p>

<p>I appreciate the distinction between <i>physical life</i>, or vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
activity, and spiritual life, but the one must necessarily be
in the other.</p>

<p>A central fountain of physical force is consistent with
scientific deductions, and physicists are inclined to admit
such a source. Many of the phenomena of the material
world are explained upon this hypothesis. The sun is supposed
to be that central fountain of physical force which inspires
activity in matter on this planet. Matter in itself is
inert and motionless; the globe we inhabit has no energy in
itself which could keep it in motion, but the forces playing
on and around it impart to it its motive power.</p>

<p>The life of any complex organism, such as that of man,
is in fact the aggregate of the vital activity of all its component
parts, and each elementary part of the fabric has its
own independent power of growth and development. If we
contemplate the history of the life of a plant, we perceive
that it grows from a germ or seed to a fabric, sometimes of
gigantic size,&mdash;it multiplies its species, by the production of
germs similar to that from which it originated. This it
performs without feeling or thinking or any effort of its own.
All the functions of which its life is composed are grouped
together under the general designation of organic functions,
or vegetative life.</p>

<p>In the building up of the animal structure we have precisely
the same operations taking place, one minute cell
added to the other, like the stone mason running up a brick
wall, each brick representing a cell, until the structure is
completed.</p>

<p>The question that we are particularly interested in is
whether this “animal life” which stimulates the growth of
the fetus from its first inception, can be any the less sacred
at one time than at another?</p>

<p>There is a general impression among a large portion of
the community that the fetus first becomes endowed with
life at the period of quickening, which is between the fourth
and fifth month of pregnancy. The time when the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
first feels the motion is considered the period when the child
becomes animated, that is, when it receives its spiritual
nature into union with its human nature.</p>

<p>The English law recognized the truth of this infamous
doctrine, in varying the punishment of an attempt to procure
abortion according to whether the woman be “quick with
child or not,” and in delaying execution when a woman
can be proved to be so, though the execution is made to proceed,
if she be not “quick,” even if she be unquestionably
pregnant. This was a most barbarous penal provision and
hardly excusable in a savage nation, much less among a
Christian people, because it is contrary to all fact, to all analogy,
to reason, and at variance with biological science.</p>

<p>If the embryo or fetus is simply an animal growing in
the mother’s womb, until the period of quickening or birth,
it would not be a crime to procure an abortion, at any time,
before these events take place. No sacrifice of a human life
would be involved, so that the act would be simply a “misdemeanor”
regulated by the degree of injury which the
mother sustained as a result of the operation. This was the
prevailing opinion for many centuries, until, in the year 692,
the Roman Empire so amended its law that the procuring of
an abortion at any time during the period of gestation
was <i>homicide</i>, murder, to be punished with death.</p>

<p>France patterned after the Roman law for a time and
made criminal abortion punishable by inflicting the death
penalty; during the French revolution this law was amended
by imprisonment for life; and later, under Napoleon, in 1810,
the law was again changed, and the punishment lessened.</p>

<p>In England there has been a gradually growing moral
sentiment to protect the defenseless child in its mother’s
womb, so that to-day England has so amended her law that
the fetus has the same protection in the uterus before as
after quickening, so that a conviction for the procurement of
criminal abortion at any time during gestation from conception
until birth is <i>felony</i> and punished by imprisonment
or transportation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>In Germany the law makes abortion a State prison offense,
and public opinion is in such a healthy state there
that anyone justly accused of this crime is quite sure to
meet with a punishment.</p>

<p>In America legislation on this subject differs widely in
the different States. In Massachusetts the barbarous distinction,
“before quickening and after,” was still recognized
a few years ago, so that the crime of abortion before quickening
was not an indictable offense. In some of the States
the laws are stringent and conform with the physiological
facts of fetal life, but, like most of our “good laws,” they are.
observed only in the breach.</p>

<p>The essential peculiarity in the process of reproduction
is the absorption of a small cell of the male, the spermatozoon,
by another small cell of the female, the ovum. This
coalescence of the two, <i>male</i> and <i>female</i> cells, is the fertilization
of the ovum, and constitutes <i>conception</i>.</p>

<p>The spermatic fluid of the male holds in suspension a
large number of very small bodies, or cells, which, from their
usually remaining in active motion for some time after they
have quitted the human body, have been erroneously considered
animalcules. A more thorough familiarity with
these bodies, and careful microscopic examinations, can distinguish
nothing in the nature of structure within them.
They are simply little oval, flattened, transparent cells between
the one-six-hundredth and one-eight-hundredth of
an inch in length, having a little thread-like “tail,” gradually
tapering to a fine point.</p>

<p>These measurements make the spermatozoa considerably
larger than the average red blood-corpuscle, which is
one-thirty-two-hundredths of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>The spermatic fluid of a single emission of a healthy
male contains thousands of these little ciliated cells, the cilia
or tails of which are seen in an active vibratile undulatory
motion, in the field of the microscope, wriggling hither and
thither, like a school of frightened fishes. This lashing motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
is continued for hours, and under favorable circumstances
for days. In the cases of microscopical examinations
of vaginal secretions of married women, for causes of sterility,
I was able to establish their activity thirty-six hours after
marital relations.</p>

<p>Through this peculiar lashing motion the ciliated cells
are propelled onward and upward, through the mouth and
cervix of the womb, thence along its body to the openings
of the Fallopian tubes, along which they migrate to the ovaries
of the female. In a healthy condition of the female generative
organs, hundreds of spermatozoa arrive at the ovaries
about the same time, a few hours or days after copulation,
but as the ova ripen and are discharged only at regular intervals,
the hundreds of ciliated bodies that travel thither
are doomed to disappointment, and gradually lose their vitality,
and perhaps are removed by absorption.</p>

<p>Of all these hundreds of germs it requires only a single
one to combine with an ovum, or a similar little cell of the
female, to constitute conception. When this combination has
been accomplished, a new being is inaugurated, another human
soul is started out, by the magic wand of nature, to
go through the different spheres of evolution, of whose
ultimatum we can have no clear conception, but this is perfectly
clear, that after this coalescence of the two germs, the
die is cast and the female becomes then only the vehicle in
which the creative forces are effecting their elaboration.</p>

<p>Coition and conception are widely different processes,
and require to be separately analyzed to be understood.</p>

<p>Coition is always a physical act, a gratification of the
senses, and, like many other human passions, is often abused
by excessive indulgence, degenerating into lust.</p>

<p>Conception, on the other hand, is purely passive, an organic
function, without consciousness on the part of the female.</p>

<p>Thus far there is a similarity in the organic processes of
conception in all mammalia, so that their embryos cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
be classified and assigned to their respective species in the
early stages of their development. Physiologists are unable
to say whether the one belongs to and will ultimately develop
into a brute animal or a human being, yet one has the
attributes of mental force, the elements of a soul, while the
other is to follow a blind instinct, without the possibility of
spiritual perception. Conception, in the one case, is simply
a vegetative or organic function, while in the other there is,
in addition, a spiritual effort to individualize a human soul.</p>

<p>The creative energy of nature is separate and independent
of the sexual act, for it does not take place during copulation
of the sexes, nor immediately after it, but hours or days
after the act is accomplished.</p>

<p>I am often called upon to say when and where the human
soul becomes associated with the human body?</p>

<p>There is a divine life, or spiritual energy, that animates
the soul from the spiritual realm. It is the correspondency
of the physical force that animates the physical body.</p>

<p>The term or phrase which I employ to designate this
force is of less importance than the definition which is given
to it, and upon this, of course, we must agree. I recognize in
such an energy or power, the primal cause or force, behind
and beyond the phenomena of nature. This force must be
universal and omnipresent, hence <i>spiritual</i>; it must be the
central source of supply for all spiritual things, so that the
doctrine of Paul is scientifically in harmony with a rationalistic
view of the subject, when he says “in Him we live
and move and have our being.”</p>

<p>The science of the <i>conservation of forces</i> teaches, that
forces are never lost, that they are indestructible and eternal.
We derive our spiritual existence from this central spiritual
sun and inherit the quality of eternity with it. Mind is
spirit and the soul is mind; this is the view of Spinoza,
who, in the second part of his work “Ethics,” employs the
terms synonymously throughout the chapter “Of the Nature
and Origin of the Mind or Soul.” Mind differentiates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
man from the inferior animal creations, and can make
him what he will.</p>

<p>Professor Carpenter in his “Principles of Human Physiology,”
tells us, that when we first discern the primordial cell,
which is to evolve itself into the human organism, we can
trace nothing that essentially distinguishes it from that
which might give origin to any other form of organic structure.
The earliest stages of its development consist in
simple multiplication of cells by “duplicative subdivision,”
so that a mass of cells comes to be produced, amidst the
several components, of which no difference can be traced;
and this also finds its parallel among the simpler organisms
of both kingdoms. There is nothing at this period to distinguish
the germs of man from that of any other vertebrated
animal, yet in the course of nine short months a
human being is developed possessing all the faculties of its
progenitor, and how could all this come to pass, if not instituted
at the moment of conception?</p>

<p>It is at this time and moment, that an <i>atom</i> of the universal
spirit becomes separated and individualized, and the
germ of a human soul is implanted, deep in the dark recesses
of nature’s laboratory. The ovum of the female
and the germ of the male coalesce, imbued by the incarnation
of the immortal spirit, and no time can be more
opportune for that union than at the very inception of our
being, because the soul and the body must interact, one on
the other.</p>

<p>In the reproduction of man, there is a higher purpose
than simply to multiply the species. The Creator can only
manifest Himself, if he has intelligent souls or spirits as
his creatures, and the reproduction of the human species is
the natural means of bringing this about.</p>

<p>The mystic union is accomplished at the time and moment
of conception, when a <i>unit</i> of the universal spirit becomes
<i>individualized</i> into a human soul. In the dark recesses
of the mother’s womb the ovum of the female and the germ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of the male, imbued by the immortal spirit, begin their
growth and development together, this constitutes the <i>triune</i>
of nature, from which the evolutions of body and soul take
their beginning.</p>

<p>Sexual instinct is not an unholy and depraved action of
the human mind, but the necessary means to an end, a finite
instrumentality of the Divine mind to procreate the
body, as an abode for the human soul. One of the attributes
of the Creator is, in the very nature of things, <i>to create</i>,
and he has thus endowed us, His creatures, for the manifestation
of His creative power. He perpetually and eternally
creates, and this has no reference to time, place or space:
just as in the beginning, God created all things, so we recognize
the supreme hand, now, to-day, and forever, ever
active in His natural element.</p>

<p>The operation of nature’s law may be contravened by
the selfish, sordid, criminal acts of the human heart, but it
cannot be frustrated. No one can console himself, that the
invincible law of evolution is at the capricious behest of finite
man, and can be neutralized and obstructed at will;
that would place a limitation on the Creator; it would contradict
the omnipotence of the Divine mind; it would place
every life or soul at the mercy of the sordid conscienceless
abortionist, and it would reduce the Divine origin of man
and the soul’s immortality to an absurdity.</p>

<p>After the fetus is murdered, its soul continues to grow
in the spiritual realm, an undying witness of the criminal
infamy which deprived it of that earthly experience which
nature intended for the children of men. It is the greatest
crime against nature to kill off a human fetus, and prematurely
hurl into eternity a human soul, which has the same
right to human experience as those already born, and, in
the eyes of God, it is no less a crime than the murder of
an adult.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Dust thou art, to dust returnest,<br />
Was not spoken of the soul.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The meaning of the term abortion is etymologically
not to be born or not to be carried out, or, in other words,
the premature expulsion of the fetus from its mother’s
womb, which is any time before it is capable of independent
existence. This is according to the construction of the law
of France, which means any time previous to the termination
of the sixth month of pregnancy. Abortion may be
accidental, that is, it may be due to a casualty which was
entirely beyond the control of the person suffering or going
through an abortion, or it may be due to disease affecting
either the embryo or the mother.</p>

<p>The word “miscarriage” is generally preferred to that of
“abortion” under the misconception that only the latter
implies criminal culpability; this, of course, is an error, because
each word means exactly the same thing, with this
difference, that one is of Latin origin, while the other is a
plain Anglo-Saxon term. An abortion that is brought about,
from other than natural causes, for the deliberate and avowed
purpose of escaping from the inconvenience, privation, and
cares of maternity, is always qualified by the adjective <i>criminal</i>.</p>

<p>In the early months of pregnancy, it very seldom, though
it occasionally does happen, that complications arise which
place the life of the mother in imminent danger; that the embryo
shares this danger in a corresponding degree is self-evident,
because the fetus is unable to live independently of
the mother any time before the expiration of the sixth
month of gestation, so that the death of the mother means
death to the fetus also.</p>

<p>Through a fall, heavy lifting, or a sudden jar, a partial
detachment is liable to occur between the placenta of the fetus
and the wall of the mother’s womb, that being the place
where the blood of the one is exchanged into the blood of
the other; from this, a hemorrhage may result, which will
not yield to rest nor to other means which experience has
taught to be useful. This loss of blood may be so great
that, if it continues, the life of both will be sacrificed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>In some women pregnancy may become complicated
with convulsions; these may be so violent, and recur so often,
as to threaten life, and they are obstinate to all medicinal
resources.</p>

<p>Contingencies of the above nature evoked the scientific
inquiry, whether abortions are ever justifiable. The answer
must invariably be, that when it is clearly seen that the
mother will surely die, and her fetus with her, an induced
abortion becomes a justifiable obstetric resource, and under
these circumstances it is not a crime nor even a sacrifice of
the embryo, which would have perished with the mother.</p>

<p>This rule of practice has been endorsed by the very
highest authority in obstetric science, and the competent
conscientious physician will readily draw the line between
cases where so radical a measure becomes necessary, and
where milder conservative measures will save the life of
both mother and child.</p>

<p>This cannot be a license for crime, except that the sordidly
depraved time server may often try to stretch the
threatening danger, but when this is done it is no less a
crime of murder in the eyes of God, than if he had premeditatedly
and willfully slain a fellow-being.</p>

<p>Such persons would not shrink from the perpetration of
any crime, be it ever so heinous and black. These wretches
are too cowardly to thrust a poniard into their victims on
the highway, but ever ready to operate in secrecy in the
abortion chamber, which is hidden from the eyes of man.
I have known abortions being sought and abortions being
committed, upon the flimsy pretext of being too weak, or
too sick at the stomach. These are shallow subterfuges,
that should not be countenanced by any conscientious practitioner.</p>

<p>Many reasons are either imaginary or pretended, and I
have often proved the fallacy of pretensions of an inability
to carry a child, after women had gone through the abortion
mills, by persuading them to become reconciled, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the time being, and that I would see them through to a
happy end, and in no case were their fears justified by subsequent
developments. There is a great deal in controlling
the minds of these women, and directing them into wholesome
channels of thought, and after that they become much
happier and contented than ever before in their married
lives.</p>

<p>If the proposition is generally accepted, that abortions
are justifiable as a therapeutical expedient, you open the
door to the criminally inclined. Wily women will impose
upon inexperienced practitioners by feigning physical suffering
as a result of pregnancy, for the purpose of getting
rid of their fetuses. There is a certain amount of hardship
and discomfort associated with the average pregnancy for a
part of the period at least, but this should be suffered with
a mother’s fortitude.</p>

<p>The testimony of the early canons of the Catholic Church
is very decisive on the crime of abortion, namely, “that the
destruction of the fetus in the womb of its parent, at any
period from the first moment of conception, is a crime equal
in turpitude to murder.”</p>

<p>In Protestant countries abortions are on the increase, and
in America it is one of the crying crimes of society, which
has so thoroughly tainted and defiled the moral sense of
American communities, that it has become next to impossible
to get a jury of twelve men who will agree on a verdict
to punish this dastardly foul crime of murder, and the abortionist
is thus encouraged in his iniquitous vocation.</p>

<p>Professor J. Taber Johnson, of Maryland, stated in his
annual oration before the State Medical Society: “The difficulty
of conviction for producing abortion is shown in the
statement of the Attorney-General of Massachusetts, that of
thirty-two arrests and trials of abortionists in that State, in a
period of eight years, not a single conviction resulted; and
this fact is equally true of other States.” This is indeed a
sad commentary on the jury system, which often degenerates
into a farce or travesty on justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The practice of abortion is on the increase. This is not
due to a single cause, but to a number, operating separately
or co-operating jointly to the same end. Boarding-house
or hotel life exercises a pernicious influence on the habits
and morals of women. They sit all day in their apartments
with indifferent occupations, or walk the streets between
meal hours, without the inspiring thoughts which a cozy
home alone can inspire. The maternal instinct languishes
or dies completely out, and if women become pregnant
while transiently domiciled, they scruple not against committing
this great crime, because their surroundings and
accommodations may not be suitable for the changed relations
which motherhood brings about. If these people had
their own little homes, were they ever so humble, their
minds would run in different grooves, their lives would be
much happier and offspring longingly desired, to fill the
nooks in the little household.</p>

<p>Want of domestic training in childhood lays the foundation
for this crime. The American girl is trained with a
view to display so-called refined accomplishments. This is
done by totally ignoring domestic duties; these are to be
shunned as menial and degrading; and when girls grow
into womanhood and are married, they naturally look upon
the ordinary household duties as drudgery, and quite unbecoming
a woman of their attainments. There is nothing
in their bosoms to arouse a pride in their homes; quite the
reverse; that principle has never been inculcated in their
youth, so that it is quite natural, that they hie to a boarding-house;
here they patronize the abortionist, or acquire proficiency
in that art themselves, from lack of nobler occupation.</p>

<p>Changed relations of the sexes destroy the maternal instinct.
A man in a man’s place, and a woman in the
sphere for which God and nature intended her, is for the
best interests of society. There is useful and profitable
work for everyone, but each should labor in his or her respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
field of natural adaptability, in which there is
plenty to do. There is, in the very nature of things, never
anything gained by a woman doing a man’s work, because
there are always plenty of men around to do that, but while
a woman is doing a man’s work, she is necessarily neglecting
a woman’s, which it is physically impossible for any
man to do for her. There is, consequently, an irretrievable
loss to society from misapplied labor. When the great
Napoleon was asked by Madam de Stael whom he considered
the greatest woman in France, his curt reply was, “She
who bore the largest number of children.” This is a tribute
to motherhood, which no one can ridicule, for whom should
we honor and respect more than the faithful, loving mother,
who makes her life subservient to that of her children?
There is no comparison between the self-denial of parental
devotion and the devotee to amusements and fashion, or
the slothful wife, who imposes sterility upon herself for the
sake of pandering to depraved appetites and frivolous pleasures.</p>

<p>Depraved associates pave the way to feticide. Some
married women are so brazen and callous, that they have
no delicacy in narrating their exploits of child murder
with a triumphant air, whenever their acquaintances are
patient and foolish enough to listen to them. These gadding
persons often contaminate the minds of newly-married
women, who had never for a moment entertained the
thought of such an awful crime, and who would have made
happy and contented mothers, were it not for the seeds of
discontent and crime which were sown in their early matrimonial
career. I have known mothers who had lost the
delicate maternal instincts, without which a mother becomes
a monster, advise their daughters and encourage them in
the perpetration of this crime.</p>

<p>Women of this type should be avoided like the dreaded
mancanilla tree, for they poison the body and soul of pure,
virtuous women, with whom they come in close contact;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
they should be shunned by the young housewife like a pestilence,
because their hands are scarlet with the blood of
their own children.</p>

<p>Unprincipled physicians are too often instrumental in
abetting criminal abortions, and this for two reasons, namely,
for the immediate lucre which is to them in hand paid, and
also for ingratiating themselves into the confidence of their
patrons, so that they may become their physician in other
ailments. These are the pariahs of the profession, but,
viewed from a business standpoint, they are very successful.
It is through the looseness with which medical colleges are
conducted in this country, many of them not deserving the
name of college, but more properly denominated a rendezvous
of self-constituted professors and ingenious advertising
sharps, that the ranks of the profession are overcrowded, because
there is no scrutiny of moral character or professional
attainments. These once labeled M. D.’s are determined to
make a professional living, and nothing deters them from
becoming <i>particeps criminis</i>, but owing to the corrupt and
depraved jury system such a thing as punishing a physician
for feticide is hardly ever heard of. I would advise my
readers to shun each and every one of these criminal monsters
as they would a pestilence. In general, “female specialist”
is but another name for abortionist, for the great
majority of these self-constituted specialists do not know
the rudiments of the science of gynecology; and women
should exercise great precaution in whose hands they place
themselves, or, rather, their lives. I know of no calling
that is capable of rendering more good to humanity than
the profession which I have made my own.</p>

<p>The honorable physician occupies a position where he
can do a great deal to improve the tone and morality of the
community. He can do more than the pulpit in preventing
feticide, because he can depict the physical dangers and
the moral turpitude, for it is to him that the deluded woman
first goes for advice. It is with him to become an oracle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
heaven; in the great majority of instances he can be instrumental
in saving human life and prevent the mother from
murdering her own child.</p>

<p>Maternity is the function of Divinity in human nature.
Who can look upon a newly-born babe without seeing something
truly Divine, a manifestation of the Divine mind to
create in his image, through the instrumentality of man, an
innocent human flower, planted upon this earth to enjoy the
fullness thereof, and what miscreant shall deny it its inheritance?</p>

<p>That husbands are often the instigators of this crime is
a fact well known to every physician of experience. I have
known of a number of cases where wives came to my office
with a woeful tale of discontent on the part of their husbands,
who did not want an “<i>increase</i>.” Such men are not
worthy the name of father or husband. They should have
been emasculated before they ever approached the marriage
altar, for they are below the brute creation and have no
claim on human affections. The luxuries of life should not
be considered as weighing against the birth of children, nor
the expense of maintaining a large family considered as an
excuse for feticide; expenses had better be reduced and economized
in other directions, so as to meet the little extra increase,
which the little stranger may cause. It is a fact, that
among thrifty people, large families are no barrier to material
success, for the blessedness of heaven rests upon them.</p>

<p>I invariably solicit an interview with the recalcitrant
spouse, and take the opportunity to tell him of the responsibilities
which married life imposes upon married couples;
that the simple gratification of the carnal senses is lust,
which can and should be controlled by every person, and
more in particular by married men. Matrimonial relations
based only on libidinous pleasure are transient and evanescent;
incompatabilities arise, which cause conflict and
dissension, ultimating in estrangement and divorces, but
when soul is wedded to soul, then they are in harmony with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the music of the spheres, and children constitute the cement
of an eternal wedlock which no man can rend asunder.</p>

<p>Abrupt termination of pregnancy constitutes in itself a
diseased process in the tissues of the womb. We have already
learned of the gradual growth of the body of the womb
to accommodate the growth of the child; when abortion
takes place there is a sudden check to this growth in the
tissues of the womb, and a low grade of inflammation invades
the entire structure. This inflammatory process fixes
or hardens the womb so that this acquired enlargement
often becomes permanent. The result is, that women can
often trace the beginning of a long series of complaints and
a shattered constitution to a so-called miscarriage. For this
reason, the after-treatment of an abortion is of much greater
importance, than after a regular normal delivery.</p>

<p>After the close of a natural gestation, the child is born,
and nature immediately sets to work to restore the womb to
its healthy normal size. No violence having been done to
the organ, there is no extra effort necessary on the part of
nature to restore it. In a premature expulsion of the fetus,
it is altogether different, the cell growth and the necessary
physiological action to build up the womb, to house the rapidly-developing
fetus, was suddenly interfered with, and the
shock which the vital activity sustains, diverts their energies
into a diseased process. Inflammation is to be guarded
against, for it constitutes the root of all pathological conditions;
chief among them is its prevention of fatty degeneration
and absorption of the superfluous tissues of the organ,
so that the womb remains heavy and enlarged. This entails
a series of consequences; its size and weight may force
it to occupy an unnatural and painful position, such as a
falling of the womb or <i>procidentia</i>, or it may turn or even
bend on itself into abnormal positions, called <i>versions and
flexions</i>; these become obstinate to treatment in proportion to
the time which elapses from the occurrence of the disease to
the time when they fall under proper treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Inflammations are limited sometimes to only portions of
the organ; this may be to the lining mucous membrane of
either the body or neck. It may also invade the entire organ
and even extend to the neighboring tissues and ligaments.
From the uterus along the Fallopian tubes to the
ovaries inflammation may spread itself, causing abscesses in
its wake and other complications which may require surgical
skill of a special nature to give permanent relief.</p>

<p>Sterility is often the result of disease caused by abortion,
and this should be another warning to thoughtless, giddy
women, who desire no children in their early married life,
because it would interfere with their regular pleasure rounds,
and so resort to abortions, which will, in all probability,
make them entirely unfit to ever become pregnant or
bear children. I have made an attempt to impress on the
reader two things; one of these is the flagrant violation of ordinary
and simple rules of health, the other the enormity of
the crime of induced abortions, and to accomplish this I
have avoided screening the subject by employing ambiguous
or finely-selected phrases, but have used plain terms which
will not shock the pure or noble in heart and mind, but may
the hypocritical, under the gauze of a false modesty.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">ANATOMY OF THE FEMALE ORGANS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bony part of the skeleton which is of particular
interest to women, is the pelvis, so called, because it forms a
basin or cavity which contains the most important female
organs of generation.</p>

<p>All the organs that are liable to the diseases of women,
bear certain anatomical relations to the pelvis, so that the
phrase, <i>pelvic diseases of women</i>, is often employed instead of
the phrase, <i>diseases of women</i>, and pelvic surgery means also,
surgical procedures, that may be employed for the relief or
cure of these diseases.</p>

<p>In confinement, the pelvis again comes into more or less
prominence, for when the diameters of the pelvic canal have
not their normal measurements, there is likely to be an obstruction
to the passage of the child into the world, so that
mechanical means must be employed to overcome the obstacle.
A broad pelvis in a woman is always a guarantee that
there will be no insurmountable difficulty in the parturient
act.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plate I</span> shows the shape and locality of the bone in the
human body, and gives also an approximate idea of the
relation of the pelvis to the rest of the body.</p>

<p>While the pelvis was referred to above as a basin or
cavity, this is only partly true, for it is also a canal or
passageway, through which the child is born. The pelvis is
divided by a prominent line into the false and true pelvis.</p>

<p>The False Pelvis is all that expanded portion of the
pelvic cavity which is above the rim or line that forms a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
circular ridge, which marks the beginning of the bony
canal to which the term true pelvis is applied.</p>

<p>The True Pelvis constitutes the lower subdivision of
the pelvic cavity. The circular ridge, which marks the
division, constitutes also the <i>inlet</i> of the true pelvis, which is
much smaller than the upper or false pelvis. Its walls are
more perfect and their lower circumference is very irregular
and forms what is called the <i>outlet</i>. Between the <i>inlet</i> and
the <i>outlet</i> we have what is called the true pelvic cavity, in
which the internal female generative organs are contained.</p>

<p>These organs are located in the following order from before
backwards: first, behind the pubis there is the bladder, and
behind this is the uterus, and thirdly and a little to the left
is the rectum.</p>

<p>On each side of the womb, but also in the small or true
pelvis, are the Fallopian tubes and ovaries.</p>

<p>In this order the anatomical relations are easily remembered,
and I believe that every woman should make it an
object to learn at least as much of her own anatomy as I
have laid down; because there is just little enough, so as not
to make it tiresome, and quite enough to insure intelligent
reading in the subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>The points of differences between the male and female
pelvis are entirely on the principle of adaptation to natural
functions. The female pelvis has a broadness or greater
prominence of the hips and a correspondingly greater pelvic
cavity, while that of the male is altogether more massive.</p>

<p>Its cavity is deeper and narrower, and the muscular
eminences and impressions on the surfaces of the bones are
much stronger marked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plate II.</span> This illustrates a cut or section, through the
middle of the pelvis, from before backwards, so as to give a
side view of the capacity of the true pelvis and of the organs
that it contains. A careful study of this plate will permanently
fix the anatomy in the reader’s mind.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The lines <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> show the planes of the inlet and outlet
of the true pelvis, and it will be seen that within these
lines the most important organs of the female are located.</p>

<p class="psh">THE BLADDER.</p>

<p>The bladder is situated at the anterior part of the pelvis.
It is in relation, <i>in front</i> with the <i>symphysis pubis</i>, behind
with the womb, some convolutions of the small intestines
being interposed; its base lies in contact with the neck of
the uterus and with the anterior wall of the vagina. The
bladder is said to be larger in the female than in the male,
and is very broad in its transverse diameter.</p>

<p class="psh">THE URETHRA.</p>

<p>The urethra is a narrow membranous canal, about an
inch and a half in length, extending from the neck of the
bladder to the external orifice. It is placed beneath the
symphysis pubis, embedded in the anterior wall of the vagina,
and its direction is obliquely downwards and forwards. Its
diameter, when undilated, is about a quarter of an inch;
behind the bladder and urethra, there is in regular order the
uterus and vagina, and behind both of these, the rectum.</p>

<p class="psh">THE PERINEUM.</p>

<p>The Perineum is the muscular triangular body between
the vagina and rectum; it constitutes a segment of the female
pelvic floor; it is the <i>prop</i> for all the pelvic organs, and for
that reason every woman should know precisely what it is,
and study the plate carefully until she understands it. The
skin covering it is of a dark color, thin and freely movable
over the underlying parts. There is no part of the pelvic
anatomy so vulnerable, because in confinement during the
passage of the child’s head into the world, the perineum is
put on a great stretch, and if the delivery progresses too
quickly or is hurried, then the tissues have no time to
stretch themselves so as to accommodate the child’s head,
and they must naturally tear.</p>

<p>The awkward and officious use of instruments will do
the same thing. I have seen the perineum torn asunder
from this cause, from the vagina and back into the rectum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plate III</span> is one of the most instructive drawings that I
could devise. It gives the reader a practical illustration
of the internal generative organs and their anatomical relations
to each other. This was a drawing from my own
dissection, and the clearness and artistic reproduction is due
to the skill of the engraver, Mr. H. X. Van de Casteele, of
this city.</p>

<p class="psh">THE VAGINA.</p>

<p>The vagina is a membranous canal, extending from the
vulva or <i>introitus</i> to the uterus. It is situated in the cavity
of the pelvis, between the bladder in front and the rectum
behind; its direction is not in a straight line, but curved
from below backwards and upwards. When distended it is
cylindrical in shape, but naturally it is flattened from before
backwards, so that its walls are ordinarily in contact with
each other. In length it averages about four inches in its
anterior wall, while its posterior wall describes a segment of
a larger circle, that makes it between one and two inches
longer. At its commencement it is constricted, and at its
upper extremity, where it is attached to the womb, it is
dilated, so as to surround the vaginal portion of the neck of
the womb (<i>see</i> Plate III, <i>c</i>) this is a short distance above the
mouth of the womb. The attachment extends higher up on
the posterior than on the anterior wall of the womb, which
makes the posterior lip of the womb longer than the anterior.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane is continuous above with that
covering the vaginal portion of the uterus; below it begins
at the vulva. Running longitudinally along the anterior
and posterior walls are distinct ridges or raphe; these are the
columns of the vagina.</p>

<p>The relations of the vagina to the neighboring organs
can be studied to better advantage by referring to Plate I.</p>

<p>Its anterior surface is concave, and is in relation with the
base of the bladder and with the urethra. Its posterior
surface is convex and connected to the anterior wall of the
rectum for the lower three-fourths of its extent, the upper
fourth being separated from the tube by a fold of the peritoneum,
the <i>recto-uterine fold</i>, which forms a <i>cul-de-sac</i> between
the vagina and rectum. Its sides give attachment superiorily
to the broad ligaments, and inferiorily to the Levatores Ani
muscles and recto-vesical fascia.</p>

<p class="psh">THE UTERUS OR WOMB.</p>

<p>The uterus is the organ of gestation, receiving the fecundated
ovum in its cavity, retaining and supporting it during
the development of the fetus, and becoming the principal
agent in its expulsion at the time of parturition. In the virgin
state it is <i>pear-shaped</i>, flattened from before backwards,
and situated in the cavity of the pelvis, between the bladder
and the rectum. It is retained in its position by the round
and broad ligaments (Plate III, <i>ii</i> and <i>kk</i>) on each side, but
<i>also by virtue of its anteverted position, and by the vagina and
perineum</i>. Its upper end or base (<i>a</i>) is directed upwards
and forwards; its lower end, or apex, is directed downwards
and backwards in the line of the axes of the inlet of the
pelvis. It therefore forms an angle with the vagina. The
uterus measures about three inches in length, two in breadth
at its upper part, and an inch in thickness, and it weighs
from an ounce to one and a half ounces in its healthy condition.</p>

<p>The fundus or base is the upper broad extremity of the
organ (<i>a</i>); it is convex, covered by peritoneum, and placed on
a line below the level of the brim of the pelvis.</p>

<p>The body (<i>b</i>) gradually narrows from the fundus to the
neck. Its anterior surface is flattened, covered by peritoneum
in the upper three-fourths of its extent, and separated from
the bladder by some coils of the small intestines; the lower
fourth is connected with the bladder.</p>

<p>The posterior surface of the body is convex, covered by
peritoneum throughout, and separated from the rectum by
some convolutions of the intestines.</p>

<p>Its lateral margins are concave and give attachment to
the Fallopian tubes (<i>n</i>), above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The round ligaments (<i>i</i>) are attached below and in front of
these, while the ligaments of the ovaries (<i>o</i>) are attached behind
and below these structures.</p>

<p>The cervix or neck of the womb (<i>c</i> <i>d</i> <i>e</i>) is the lower
rounded and constricted portion of the uterus; around its
circumference is attached the upper end of the vagina, which
extends upwards a greater distance behind than in front.</p>

<p>At the vaginal extremity of the uterus is, in the virgin
womb, a round, but after childbirth a transverse aperture,
the <i>os uteri</i> or mouth of the womb, bounded by two lips, the
anterior of which is thick, the posterior narrow and long.</p>

<p class="psh">THE FALLOPIAN TUBES.</p>

<p>The Fallopian tubes, or oviducts (<i>n</i>) convey the ova from
the ovaries to the cavity of the uterus. They are two in
number, one on each side, situated in the free margin of the
broad ligament, extending from each superior angle of the
uterus to the ovaries. Each tube is about four inches in
length; its canal is exceedingly minute, and commences at
the superior angle of the womb by a minute orifice, the <i>ostium
internum</i>, or internal mouth, which will hardly admit a
fine bristle; it continues narrow along the inner half of the
tube, and then gradually widens into a trumpet-shaped extremity,
which becomes contracted at its termination. This
opening is called the <i>ostium abdominale</i>, or abdominal mouth,
because it communicates freely with the abdominal cavity.
The margins of this extremity are surrounded by a series of
fringe-like processes, termed <i>fimbriæ</i>, and one of these processes
is connected with the outer end of the ovary. This
part of the Fallopian tube is called the fimbriated or fringed
extremity (<i>m</i>).</p>

<p class="psh">THE OVARIES.</p>

<p>The ovaries are analogous to the testes in the male. They
are two oblong flattened and oval bodies, situated one on
each side of the uterus, in the posterior part of the broad
ligament behind and below the Fallopian tubes. Each ovary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
is connected, by its anterior margin, to the broad ligament,
by its inner extremity to the uterus by a proper ligament
of the ovary, and by its outer end to the fimbriated extremity
of the Fallopian tube by a short ligamentous cord.
The ovaries are of a whitish color, and present either a
smooth or a puckered uneven surface. They are each about
an inch and a half in length, three-quarters of an inch in
width, and about a third of an inch thick, and weigh from
one to two drams.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">MENSTRUATION AND MENSTRUAL DISORDERS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first appearance of the menses marks an epoch in
the life of the girl which ushers in womanhood. It is the
harbinger of the fruitfulness of the maiden, whose limbs
now become rounder, and her hips widen out, while the
breasts increase in size and the entire aspect undergoes peculiar
changes, which all point to the approaching condition
of maturity.</p>

<p>The term is derived from the <i>Latin</i> plural <i>menses</i>, meaning
month, from moon, and it is an actual fact that the lunar
forces seem to influence this physiological function, inasmuch
as it recurs every four weeks; most women menstruate
during the first quarter, and only a very few during the
new or full moon.</p>

<p>During infancy and childhood, the sexual system of the
female is inactive. The menstruation begins, in a temperate
climate, about the fourteenth or fifteenth year of life, and
ceases at the age of forty-five or a little later.</p>

<p>The climate exerts a marked influence in determinating
the first appearance of menstruation, which is further influenced
by the conditions of life and society in which the
child is brought up.</p>

<p>The diversity in the ages at which children menstruate
in different countries cannot be laid to any constitutional peculiarities
of the races. Observation has established that,
when children of the same race and family are brought
from a hot to a colder climate, the advent of the first
menstruation changes. These girls menstruate not so
young as their older sisters, but begin about at the same
age as those who are born in the colder climate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>In hot countries, for instance in Africa, the negroes and
girls in East India begin to have their periods at the age of
ten to twelve years. In Sweden and Norway the average
age for the first menstruation is sixteen, while further north,
in Lapland, the ages vary from eighteen to twenty years.
Next in order of importance, influencing the menstrual
epoch, are the surroundings and food.</p>

<p>In the same climate there are differences in the ages of
children that are entirely due to these causes. Children
who are pampered and who are nurtured in ease and luxury
menstruate earlier than those of the poor or even of the
middle class, who are brought up in habits of industry.</p>

<p>We observe again a difference in the ages between those
who are reared in the country or rural districts and the
dwellers in the cities, whether it be in luxurious apartments
or in tenement houses. The former grow older and stronger
than the latter before the <i>show</i> begins.</p>

<p>The temperament also greatly influences the development
of the function; children who are nervous, irritable, and of
a sanguineous temperament, menstruate earlier than those of
sedate habits.</p>

<p>The color of the hair and complexion are also indices of
the respective appearance of the menses in the <i>brunette</i> and
<i>blonde</i>. It has been observed that the dark-complexioned
girls menstruate sooner under similar conditions than the
blondes. Weakly children, who are delicate from some constitutional
habit, or whose organism has suffered from disturbances
of indigestion or suffered severely from teething
in early childhood, menstruate earlier than their stronger
and robust sisters.</p>

<p>The quantity of the natural menstrual discharge, as well
as the time or duration, varies greatly in health with different
individuals. We first notice a slimy discharge, which
soon becomes tinged with blood, and after one or two days
it is almost of pure blood. The flow generally lasts three or
four days, very seldom only one day, and sometimes a week
to ten days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The monthly recurrence of the menstrual periods averages
thirty years; in temperate climates it may overreach this figure
a little, while in hot climates it comes much below this
average.</p>

<p>It does not follow as a rule that because a woman began
to menstruate quite young, the change of life will take place
earlier. This also depends much upon temperament, habit
and mode of life.</p>

<p>Physiologists have established, by carefully-prepared statistics,
that the average period of menstruation for women
who began to menstruate early is thirty-three years, while
those who commenced late have an average of only twenty-seven
years.</p>

<p>When a woman is forty-five years of age, we may, however,
as a rule, look for the change of life to set in; if she goes
beyond this age, she may be taken as the exception.</p>

<p>The cavity of the womb is the principal source from
which the blood comes; while the ovaries and tubes are also
greatly congested with blood, the amount that comes from
them must be very small.</p>

<p>The blood that comes from the womb is not different
from blood coming from any other source; the changes and
peculiarity of the menstrual show are due to its passage
through the vagina, where it becomes contaminated with
vaginal secretions.</p>

<p>It is supplied from the blood-vessels of the womb, oozing
through the mucous membrane of that organ, just as in a
case of nosebleed. The entire womb is more or less swollen,
and more especially the mucous lining, so that it corresponds,
in many instances, to an inflammatory process, and
for that very reason, a sudden check of the menstrual flow
will often result in a regular subacute or acute inflammation
of the womb. If the discharge of blood from the
uterus is in small quantities and a gradual, steady flow, it
becomes so altered by the secretions in its passage through
the vagina that it does not coagulate, but when it is poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
out more rapidly or in larger quantities, the menstrual
blood coagulates or congeals in the same manner as if it
were derived from other sources.</p>

<p>If a woman becomes pregnant, the menses as a rule are
suspended during the child-bearing period, and usually remain
absent after the child is born so long as the woman
nurses the child. I have known one woman who menstruated
during her entire pregnancy, and another who had
had eight children and never menstruated in her life, yet
she was, and always had been, in perfectly good health:
thus we see, that there is no rule without exceptions.</p>

<p>An essential part of the menstrual function is that in
which the ova or female germ cells ripen and are expelled
from the ovary. The menstruation is only a reflex or side
issue, to a more important part that is going on in the female
generative system; this is termed <i>ovulation</i>, or the ripening
and expulsion of the human egg from the tissues of
the ovaries. In the physiological process that operates in the
economy of nature for reproduction, the <i>ovaries</i> are the principal
organs. The other organs are simply accessory, and
indeed many of the lower animals have no other organs
than the ovaries for the perpetuation of their species.</p>

<p>In the human female, the ovaries consist of a tough fibrous
tissue, between whose meshes are little cysts, which
are called <i>Graafian vesicles</i>, and these little vesicles serve as
the nests in which the ova or little germ cells mature.</p>

<p>These ova which are imbedded in the Graafian vesicles
are so small that they can only be seen by a high magnifying
power.</p>

<p>The activity of the ovaries begins at puberty, and ceases
with the change of life, or menopause.</p>

<p>The approach of the menses is signalized by a certain
group of symptoms, which clearly indicate a congestion of
the pelvic organs.</p>

<p>There is generally a drawing sensation in the back and
thighs, and a sensitiveness upon pressure in the regions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the ovaries and the womb. There is a feeling of lassitude
and weakness of the limbs, sometimes hot flushes changing
off with chills, and often a feverish condition, which will
last until the flow is fully established.</p>

<p>Professor Dalton says: “In many birds, for example, the
plumage assumes at this period more varied and brilliant
colors; and in the common fowl the comb or ‘crest’ enlarges,
and becomes red vascular. In the American deer,
the coat which, during the first year is mottled with white,
becomes in the second year of a uniform tawny or reddish
tinge. In nearly all species, the limbs become more compact
and the body more rounded; and the whole external
appearance is so altered, as to indicate, that the animal has
arrived at the period of puberty, and is capable for reproduction.”</p>

<p>In the human subject, the child now becomes conscious
of the sexual instinct, however chaste or virtuous her mind,
for we must not dull our intelligence with the idea that the
sexual function is unholy; it is no more so than to say our
prayers; so that an additional duty is now incumbent upon
mother or guardian.</p>

<p>The child must be made to know that she must be more
reserved and guarded in her relations with the male sex;
that she no longer can romp or play on the knees of male
friends or visitors, and that it is dangerous and unbecoming
to be left alone with them. A little later on, she must be
apprised that she too may become a <i>mother</i>, and that that
would be a great disgrace for one so young and not married.
The child thus learns to protect herself against the insidious
smiles and snares of the seducer, for he is ever abroad,
and often family friend and trusted adviser.</p>

<p>There are beings who are men in form only, but at
heart are black villains, and selfish brutes. When the mischief
is done, then it is too late to repent of a mother’s negligence,
or to bewail a child’s disgrace and man’s perfidy;
the three combined make one of the most distressing scenes
that it has ever been my misfortune to behold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Successive crops of eggs ripen, and are discharged by the
adult female at each menstrual period.</p>

<p>I have already said that the ovum is contained in the
Graafian vesicle, in which it grows and matures, as the fruit
ripens on a tree, so the Graafian vesicle gradually ripens
for the expulsion of the ovum, which gradually makes its
way to the surface of the ovary. Within the Graafian
vesicle the serous fluid accumulates, so that it ruptures and
discharges its little ovum, which is taken up by the fringed
extremity of the Fallopian tube, and carried along the oviduct
into the womb, from which it escapes into the vagina,
and is lost, provided conception has not taken place.</p>

<p>Investigations have been made as to the number of ova
certain mammalia discharge, and it has been found to correspond
with the number of young that the animal produces
at birth. Where a litter consists of from three to
twenty, as in the bitch and the sow, a similar number of
eggs ripen, and are discharged at the period of œstruation.</p>

<p>In the cow or mare, and in the human female, as a rule,
only one egg is discharged at each period of ovulation.</p>

<p>The discharge of ripened ova does, however, occur in exceptional
cases without any sign of the menstrual show, and
the person may be susceptible to conception, so that we may
reasonably infer, that ovulation constitutes the most important
function of the menstrual period.</p>

<p class="psh">MENSTRUAL DISORDERS.</p>

<p>These are designated by different terms, not because each
name signifies a particular disease, but simply an indefinite
symptom of a diseased condition. In other cases menstrual
disorder may produce symptoms that are common to widely
different diseases. In other words, the phrase menstrual
disorder, without being qualified as to its particular cause,
means, from a practical standpoint nothing upon which a
treatment can be intelligently based. Not any more than a
cough which is simply an irritation of the bronchial nerves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and may be due to a bronchitis or pneumonia, or it may
not be due to any pulmonary affection at all, as, for instance,
in the case where an aneurismal tumor presses on the bronchial
nerves, and excites severe paroxysms of coughing. A
great many menstrual disorders are due, not to any disease
of the generative organs, but to an affection of the nervous
system.</p>

<p>Menstruation may be precocious in some girls, and if
the discharge is not accompanied with the usual symptoms
of backache and some of the other symptoms that characterize
the normal appearance of the menses, or if the girl
is otherwise not fully developed, and has in this climate not
reached her twelfth or fourteenth year, it constitutes a sign
of a disease. If, however, the show recurs at certain intervals,
it is not to be considered with the same degree of
apprehension that it would be if it recurred at irregular
intervals.</p>

<p>The sanguineous discharge which shows itself at the
genitals during an acute attack of an infectious disease, has
no relation whatever with the menstrual function; this may
take place in children at any early age.</p>

<p>We often see girls who are not yet thirteen, who still wear
short clothes and go to school, that menstruate regularly,
but with this precocious menstruation there is also a corresponding
development of the body which gives them a
womanly appearance. Such girls should not be permitted to
expose themselves to the inclemency of the weather, because
they are much more liable to take cold, which may result
in inflammations, than girls in whom the menses have not
appeared.</p>

<p>Girls of a scrofulous taint or other hereditary habits of
constitution, often begin to menstruate prematurely; outdoor
exercise and cod liver oil with cold sponging on retiring
at night are the proper resources for building them up.</p>

<p class="psh">AMENORRHŒA.</p>

<p>This term is employed for the purpose of designating an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
absence of the menstrual flow in persons who are old enough
to menstruate, and in whom there is no physiological reason
for its suppression, such as being too young, after the
change of life, or during pregnancy and while nursing the
child on the breasts.</p>

<p>We find this disorder of the natural function of menstruation
more among the women of the rich and affluent
whose lives are spent in indolence and luxury; this is to be
ascribed to lack of sufficient exercise to stimulate the nervous
and sanguineous systems to the performance of their healthy
functions.</p>

<p>The amenorrhœa, or a retarded menstruation in young
girls, is oftener the result of a general debility than of a disease
of either the womb or ovaries. We have here again
about the same causes playing their pernicious role as in
precocious menstruation in weakly children; that is, that the
same causes produce directly opposite results. The scrofulous
and hereditary taints always interfere with the proper
and healthy development of the system; in amenorrhœa
they appear to be a hindrance to the formation and growth
of the red blood corpuscles. In some girls the suppression
of the courses appears to be a wise conservative provision of
nature, because the girls are already so weak and bloodless
that even the loss of a very small amount would only increase
the anæmia, so that in these cases it is not so much a
question of “bringing on the courses” as of building up the
constitution, and enriching the blood in order to bring about
the desired result.</p>

<p>Chlorosis, or the green sickness, is not simply an anæmia
or a bloodlessness, but a physiological incapacity of
the system to prepare the required blood cells for the sanguineous
fluid, and this is, indeed, the most frequent cause
of the disorder under consideration. Chlorosis is a disease
that is peculiar to the female sex, beginning as a rule at the
age of approaching puberty, between the fourteenth and
twentieth year, so that there appears to be a physiological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
relation between the blood genesis on the one hand, and
the development of womanhood on the other.</p>

<p>In some cases we can trace the impoverished condition of
the blood to unhealthy dwellings, impure air, want of exercise,
improper diet, nervousness, the reading of exciting, amorous
novels, and the practice of masturbation or self-abuse.
On the contrary, the disease is often developed under the
most moral and exacting discipline and hygienic surroundings.</p>

<p>I have known girls who lived in the country, enjoyed
horseback riding, ate nutritious and wholesome food, and
whose solitary moments were beyond suspicion, yet at the
age of puberty they commenced to fade in color, and fail in
strength, gradually growing paler and weaker, until they became
chlorotic and bloodless. This can only be explained
on the theory that the period in which nature was preparing
the system for the purposes she had in view, caused a shock
to the nervous system, which so disarranged the functions
that the <i>sanguineous</i> system did not respond to the growth
of the <i>generative</i> system.</p>

<p>Then there is another class of cases, where girls menstruate
before they are old enough, and without their bodies
showing any visible evidence of developed womanhood, who
belong to the most obstinate cases for successful treatment.</p>

<p>The relative diminution of the red blood cells to the
healthy standard is in some cases truly alarming. In the
average healthy blood, there are, in one thousand parts of
blood, one hundred and thirty parts of red blood cells; this
falls to sixty, and even forty parts in the thousand in the
chlorotic patient.</p>

<p>It is one of the peculiarities of this disease, that while
the muscular tissue wastes away, the fatty tissue is not only
preserved, but it sometime increases, so that in a family of
several girls, the chlorotic girl is considered the ‘<i>most fleshy</i>,’
but as fat is not flesh, the appearance is deceptive.</p>

<p>When we stop to think a moment, that the <i>red blood corpuscles</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
are the messengers which absorb the oxygen in the
lungs during the respiratory movements, and carry it to
the different organs and tissues of the body, without which
all tissue change would cease. And that the same red blood
cells must return again to the lungs for exhaling the carbonic
acid, one of the waste products of tissue growth, then
the diminution of the red blood cells in the proportion above
given, must affect the entire system very injuriously.</p>

<p>This is indeed the case; the natural respiratory movements
are insufficient on the slightest exertion, so that
patients tell us that when they walk a little fast, go up
the stairs, or even sweep the room, they feel a shortness of
breath.</p>

<p>There are other symptoms that point to carbonic acid
poisoning, which it will be interesting to review. A great
majority of these symptoms are to be found in every case of
chlorosis. The muscles become weak at first, because their
nutrition is interfered with, and they waste away, and secondly
they become irritable from the poisonous presence of
the carbonic acid, and so are often very painful. The patients
are easily tired out; some, indeed, feel tired all the time, getting
up in the morning as worn out as when they retired at
night.</p>

<p>The nervous system suffers as much, because the principal
nerve food is oxygen, and if there is no blood, there can
be no oxygen; a starved nerve is a painful nerve. We find
neuralgias, affecting the different parts of the body, the rule;
when these are located in the external muscles, they are
easily recognized, but when located in the deep organs, as
the ovaries or the womb, they are generally mistaken for
something else. The nerves of these individuals being in
such an irritable state, it is natural to infer, that hysteria is
often to be found as one of the complications, so that habitual
sadness, and abnormal longings after chalk, lead pencils,
and other indigestible articles are prominent symptoms.</p>

<p>The circulatory system suffers derangements that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
characteristic of chlorosis. Palpitation of the heart is a
prominent symptom; this is partly due to the irritation of
the carbonic acid on the cardiac nerves, and partly to sensitiveness
of the patient, owing to a morbidly-increased sensibility
of the whole body. Chlorotic patients blush up at
times, only to be followed by a green paleness that is peculiar
to the disease. Pain in the region of the heart, and disturbances
of the digestion, are sometimes prominent symptoms.
There is no feeling of hunger; eating is not so much
from hunger, but more from a sense of duty to keep up the
strength. A heavy or full feeling is often experienced after
a meal, and a sourish eructation will give relief to the oppression,
because the walls of the stomach are relaxed and
in sympathy with the general debility.</p>

<p>But in all cases of chlorosis the sexual functions are the
seat of the greatest disturbance; amenorrhœa or the suppression
of the menses is the most prominent symptom.
The ovaries no longer seem to expel ripened ova, for there
are no indications that point to their activity, because there
is not only an absence of the show, but also an absence of
the other signs that were noted when we considered menstruation
and ovulation.</p>

<p>There are a great many other diseases of which amenorrhœa
is a prominent symptom; these will be referred to
when separate diseases become the subject of special inquiry.</p>

<p>The treatment of amenorrhœa is, indeed, in the great
majority of cases, the treatment of chlorosis, and that should
be conducted on common-sense principles. If the child has
vicious practices, they must be corrected, and everything else
that has been mentioned as a cause must be abandoned.
Children who were once robust and strong require electrical
treatment, while those who were naturally weak require
nourishing food and tonics. If there is in the entire pharmacopœa
a remedy that deserves the name of a specific, it is
to that one which I suggest in amenorrhœa due to chlorosis
or anæmia. Iron preparations are very numerous; every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
physician has his favorite prescription; some are to be praised
more for their elegance and flavor than for any virtue that
they possess. If in these cases any positive and decided result
is to follow the administration of iron, it must be given
in such a mild form that it can be taken in great quantities
without irritating the stomach or interfering with digestion.
If the contents of the whole alimentary canal
are saturated or impregnated with the ferruginous medicine,
there will be astonishing curative effects.</p>

<p>I have often observed chlorotic cases who have made
the rounds of the different iron springs, and who have taken
the numerous and various fancy elixirs, without the slightest
perceptible effect, bloom up, after being fed, so to speak, on
some harmless iron preparation, which was astonishing
to themselves and surprising to their friends. The following
is my favorite prescription for chlorosis or anæmia:</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">NO. I.</p>

<table id="tt01" summary="tt01">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdr">Take:</td>

</table>


<p>Mix with sufficient water to make into a hard mass and
divide into one hundred and fifty pills, and roll in powdered
cinnamon.</p>

<p>Take three pills three times a day and after three days
increase to four pills at one dose three times a day, then
after another three days increase to five pills as many times
a day as before; if these doses are not at first borne, begin
with less, and if there is no costiveness or tendency thereto,
omit the aloes.</p>

<p>If there is reason to believe that the impoverishment of
the blood is partly or wholly due to scorfulous taints, then it
is advisable to take fresh, pure cod liver oil in conjunction
with the iron pills; three boxes of pills are, as a rule,
necessary to effect a cure.</p>

<p>It happens quite often in chlorosis or anæmia that there
is a distressing dyspepsia or indigestion with loss of appetite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
In these cases I would first advise to put the stomach in
order; this is done by first avoiding all indigestible food,
such as cakes, pies, and puddings, and taking the following
medicine:</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">NO. II.</p>

<table id="tt02" summary="tt02">

</table>

<p>Take a tablespoonful three times a day, and if the bowels
move freely take less.</p>

<p>Hygiene in the treatment of every disease is to be an
important factor; all vicious habits must be abandoned.</p>

<p class="psh">DYSMENORRHŒA.</p>

<p>Difficult or painful menstruation is the definition of the
above word; all painful menstrual disorders that take place
either before or during the menstrual flow come under this
designation.</p>

<p>The seat of the pain, when of a colicky nature, is in the
uterus; when a continuously dull ache is in the small of the
back, it is located in the nervous plexus in the small of the
back. The pain is very often in the ovaries and in that
portion of the peritoneal membrane which folds over all the
pelvic organs and extends on the sides of the womb, constituting
the broad ligaments; when the pain is confined to
these structures, it is principally felt below the stomach and
over the lower part of the bowels.</p>

<p>Painful menstruation is a prominent symptom of a great
many diseases, and it often strains the ingenuity of the most
clever specialist to trace the symptoms to their real cause.</p>

<p>Obstructive dysmenorrhœa, as its name implies, is due
to some hindrance or obstacle to the escape of blood from
the cavity of the womb. The obstruction may exist in the
neck of the womb, at its mouth, or in the vagina. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
obstruction is in the neck of the womb, it may be congenital
or date from birth. The constriction or narrowness may be
due to an acquired inflammation of the lining membrane of
the neck of the womb. Every inflammation causes a swelling
of the tissues, and if the inflammation continues, the
swelling becomes permanent and a <i>stricture</i> is the result.</p>

<p>Such strictures are often the result of the applications of
strong <i>caustics</i> and meddlesome tampering by the ignorant
specialist and abortionist. The application of the <i>electrical
current</i> by means of the uterine electrode is the most modern
and effectual method of treating these cases successfully.</p>

<p>Flexion of the womb is understood to be a condition in
which the uterus is flexed or bent upon itself at a sharp angle,
just as a rubber hose that is bent sharply on itself becomes
compressed at the kink so as to shut off the flow, in this manner
the flow of blood from the cavity of the womb is partly
shut off, and the obstruction is the cause of the painful
menstruation.</p>

<p>In some women who have flexion or a bent womb there
is no obstruction, because the probe passes the canal freely;
in these cases dysmenorrhœa must be traced to some other
cause. If it is clearly established that flexion is the cause
of the obstruction, the most successful treatment is the electrical
current. I have often had cases where little mucous
growths no larger than a small marble, grew in the canal
and obstructed the free escape of blood; after these were
removed, the dysmenorrhœa ceased at once.</p>

<p>Other obstructions may be due to a stricture of the vagina
or some deformity of the hymen; a very slight surgical operation
will permanently relieve both of these hindrances.</p>

<p>There is a much larger proportion of cases that suffer
from painful menstruation in whom the uterine organs are
perfectly healthy, but who are systematically injured by dishonest
or hungry specialists, by being subjected to <i>local treatments</i>.
I have had cases of this nature fall into my hands
very often. They had made the rounds of the specialists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and had been made the innocent prey of avaricious professional
competition, so that it is of the greatest importance
to distinguish this class of cases from those in which
the pelvic organs are the seat of the difficulty.</p>

<p>Nervous and congestive dysmenorrhœas are particularly
adapted for the hygiene of home treatment. Nervous or neuralgic
dysmenorrhœa is very often overlooked, and treated
as a local lesion of the womb.</p>

<p>The psychical exaggeration which many women experience
at the approach of the menses is abnormally heightened
in dysmenorrhœa. The pains in the back, in the hips,
and in the lower part of the abdomen disturb the normal
operations of the mind. The irritation of the nerves of the
womb is often reflected to distant organs, and pain is felt
in remote regions. Some women suffer only just a day or
two preceding the flow, while others suffer severely during
the entire period, so that they are forced to keep to their
bed the greater part of the time.</p>

<p>Professor William Goodell, one of the most profound and
original female specialists in America, has this to say in a
recent publication: “I have learned to unlearn the idea&mdash;
and that was the hardest task of all&mdash;that uterine symptoms
are not always present in cases of uterine disease; or that,
when present, they necessarily come from uterine disease.
The nerves are mighty mimers, the greatest of mimics, and
they cheat us by their realistic personations of organic disease
and especially of uterine disease. Hence it is that even
seemingly urgent uterine symptoms may be merely nerve
counterfeits of uterine disease. I have, therefore, long since
given up the belief, which, with many, amounts to a creed,
that the womb is at the bottom of every female ailment.</p>

<p>“Nerve strain, or nerve exhaustion, comes largely from the
frets, the griefs, the worries, the carks and cares of life. Yet
although the imagination undoubtedly affects it, it is not a
mere whim or imaginary disease, as all healthy women and
physicians think; but it is the veriest of realities. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
some flippant talker or some slipshod thinker scoffs at nervousness
as a sham disorder, I say to him: ‘Can the bribe
of a principality keep you from blushing when you are
ashamed, or from blanching when you are afraid?’ Under
the flitting sense of shame or of fear these vasomotor disturbances
are momentarily beyond your control; and so
they are in the nervous woman, whose vital organs are, as
it were&mdash;not transiently but&mdash;perpetually blushing and
blanching under deficient brain-control over the lower nerve
centers.</p>

<p>“Strangely enough, the most common symptoms of nerve
disorder in women are the very ones which tradition and
dogmatic empiricism attribute to womb disease.</p>

<p>“They are, in the order of their frequency, great weariness
and more or less of wakefulness and inability to
walk any distance, a bearing-down feeling, headache, nape-ache
and backache, scant, or <i>painful</i>, or delayed, or suppressed
menstruation, cold feet, and irritable bladder, general
spinal and pelvic soreness, and pain in one ovary,
usually the left, or in both ovaries. The sense of exhaustion
is a remarkable one; the woman is always tired, she
passes the day tired, and she goes to bed tired, and she
wakes up tired, often, indeed, more tired than when she fell
asleep. She sighs a great deal, she has low spirits, and her
arms and legs become numb so frequently that she fears
palsy or paralysis.</p>

<p>“There are many other symptoms of nerve strain, but
since they are not so distinctly uterine, and, therefore, not so
misleading, I shall not enumerate them. Now, let a nervous
woman with some of the foregoing group of symptoms
recount them to a female friend, and she will be told that
she has womb disease. Let her consult a physician and ten
to one he will think the same thing and diligently hunt for
some uterine lesion. If one be found, no matter how trifling,
he will attach to it undue importance, and treat it
heroically as the offending organ. If no visible disease of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the external organs be discoverable, he will lay the blame
to the invisible endometrium, or on the unseeable ovaries,
and continue the local treatment. In any event, whatever
the inlook or the outlook, a local treatment is bound to be
the issue.”</p>

<p>The nervous variety of painful menstruation is frequently
due to impoverishment of the blood, which, as we
have learned, is often the direct cause of irritable nerves.
The same treatment as for chlorosis will give the desired
relief: the treatment with iron pills. If the stomach is
deranged from dyspeptic disorders, then my dyspeptic mixture,
No. II, is to be given. But there are cases that are
purely neuralgic without any apparently serious lesion of
the blood; cases in which the neuralgia of the womb or
ovaries is probably due to exposure to cold or some other
indiscretion; here the following recipe will effect a cure in
the course of several months:</p>

<p>Mix. Take a teaspoonful in a tumblerful of milk three
times a day, between meals.</p>

<p>Congestive dysmenorrhœa is oftener in the nature of an
acute or sudden attack, except when it is due to a chronic
inflammation of the lining membrane of the womb. It is
often brought on by a sudden or inadvertent exposure, just
at the time when the menses should make their regular appearance.</p>

<p>Persons of a plethoric habit and those who have been
the subjects of inflammations either of the womb or in the
tissues surrounding the womb, are more liable to this form
of dysmenorrhœa than others. It will often be ushered
in with a chill, followed soon with fever. There is headache,
the skin becomes dry and hot, and often there is considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
irritability of the bladder, straining of the rectum
and diarrhœa. Unless the pain is due to an obstinate displacement,
it yields to proper treatment. For the straining
and irritable bladder a hot sitz-bath should be employed
for ten to fifteen minutes. In the absence of a suitable vessel
for a sitz-bath an ordinary bathtub can be used by filling
it six or eight inches with water, at a temperature of 104°F.,
and while sitting in the bath allow the boiling water
to run slowly into it, so as to keep the temperature up.
These sitz-baths should be taken several times a day, and
after each bath the patient should rub herself thoroughly
dry and wear flannel next to the skin. The extremities
and feet should also be kept warm by wearing woolen hose.</p>

<p>Towels wrung out of hot water should be carefully
folded and applied to the lower region of the abdomen and
then covered over with a thickly folded flannel cloth so as
to retain the heat and moisture; when the towel has cooled
off repeat the dipping in hot water.</p>

<p>The Femina vaginal capsules are of inestimable value in
this class of diseases. They relieve congestion of the womb
by allaying the irritation. The best time to use one is just
before retiring, and after taking a sitz-bath, or a vaginal
injection of hot water, or both. Persons who are of a costive
habit should pay particular attention that, about the
time their monthlies come around, their bowels act freely,
and to accomplish this purpose the Femina laxative tablets
should be taken, one each night for several nights before
the courses are expected.</p>

<p class="psh">MENORRHAGIA AND METRORRHAGIA.</p>

<p>By <i>menorrhagia</i> is meant, as the composition of the term
implies, an excessive flow of blood at the regular monthly
period; by <i>metrorrhagia</i>, a flow of blood from the womb at
any time irrespective of the regular menstrual periods.
Neither of these forms can be called a disease, as they are
solely the symptoms of several kinds of uterine affections.
In the course of our investigations, we will find that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of the most prominent and common symptoms of different
womb diseases is <i>hemorrhage</i> of the womb.</p>

<p>If the hemorrhage is the result of general debility from
protracted nursing, the child must be weaned, and recipe
No. I, with a nourishing diet, will effect a cure.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage may be due to the presence of a fungoid inflammation,
tumors, or affections of the mouth or neck of
the womb, or congestion of the ovaries.</p>

<p>It is very often due to a “bad getting up” from confinement,
where the womb has never returned to its original size.
Sometimes it is due to a portion of the afterbirth that was
retained in the cavity of the womb. It is also a symptom of
cancer. As I have already said, it may be the symptom of
so many different diseases that the proper course to pursue
is to find an <i>honest</i> and competent physician to make a thorough
examination, for the purpose of deciphering the real
cause, and when that is discovered, it is as a rule, an easy
matter to remove it and thus afford the patient permanent
relief.</p>

<p>There is no remedy which on the whole is so effectual
in controlling hemorrhage, no matter from what cause, as:</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">NO. IV.</p>

<table id="tt04" summary="tt04">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdr">Take:</td>
  <td class="tdl">Fluid ex. of ergot</td>
  <td class="tdr">1 ounce</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>Dose: a teaspoonful in a little water every four hours
until the flow ceases, or until a physician is consulted to
diagnose the case. In pregnancy, the administration of
ergot is not admissible; cold water compresses are also useful
in checking uterine hemorrhage, and the utmost quietude
should be observed.</p>

<p>Nervous exhaustion from protracted confinement, or
mental worry from the loss of a child or the death of a
friend, may also cause uterine hemorrhage. The ergot is
useful in these cases, with a change of air and scenery.</p>

<p class="pch">HISTOLOGY OF INFLAMMATION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inflammations</span> of the various tissues assume different
forms as far as the gross appearances are concerned, but the
underlying condition is precisely the same. The various
types of inflammations that are produced by one and the
same process are of considerable scientific interest, but to
the practical and inquiring reader, whose principal object is
to obtain sufficient information to be able to cure herself, it
would be confusing were I to attempt a description of their
differences.</p>

<p>There is no word that is so often employed as <i>inflammation</i>,
as a designation of disease, and when we learn that
there is only one kind of inflammatory process, whether of
the brain, the lungs, liver, kidneys or bowels, the entire subject
of inflammatory diseases at once becomes greatly simplified,
because if you understand one you must understand
all.</p>

<p>I will in the subsequent chapters speak only, or principally,
of inflammatory affections of the different organs that
come within the province of this specialty, and I am convinced
that if the reader will bear with me, so that I may
take sufficient time and space to explain the most advanced
scientific views of inflammatory processes, she will be more
than compensated, by a clearer understanding of what will
be said in succeeding pages.</p>

<p>Inflammation comprises a series of phenomena, which
partly take place in the vascular apparatus or blood vessels
and partly in the tissues comprising the structure of the organ.
Inasmuch as inflammation is not a single process, a
definition of a few words is insufficient to convey to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
mind its real meaning. If I were simply to describe the peculiarities
of the circulation, that characterize the inflammatory
process, we should only have an incomplete idea of the
changes that were taking place.</p>

<p>Since the time of Galen, who lived two hundred years
after Christ, <i>inflammation</i> was recognized by four cardinal
symptoms, namely redness (<span class="smcap">Ruber</span>), <i>swelling</i> (<span class="smcap">Tumor</span>), <i>pain</i>
(<span class="smcap">Dolor</span>) and the increased temperature (<span class="smcap">Calor</span>). To these
modern pathologists have added a fifth symptom, which is
lessened or diminished function (<span class="smcap">Functio Læsa</span>).</p>

<p>The above five cardinal symptoms can be established in
the majority of the acute stages of inflammation: in the
chronic or subacute variety, one or the other symptom may
be absent, or so obscured as to escape notice.</p>

<p>The nature and structure of the tissue materially modify
some symptoms and exclude others, so that redness, pain
and even perceptible swelling may be absent. Galen already
in his time attributed the redness to an increased blood supply
and the swelling to an exudation of lymph or serum,
through the walls of the blood vessels: this was as near the
truth as scientists arrived, until within our own time. The
discoveries in this field of science have been greatly enriched
in the last twenty years through the researches of the
German school. Various theories have been advanced from
time to time, as to the probable causes or processes that
are going on in the tissues while inflammation is active.
One observer believed that he had found the solution of the
inquiry in a supposed spasmodic contraction of the capillary
blood vessels, another in their paralysis, while still another
adhered to the belief of a neurotic affection. Professor Virchow,
the father of the modern school of pathological science,
ascribed the conditions of the tissues to an irritable state of
the inflammatory process, inducing an exaggerated cell
growth; while his former pupil, Cohnheim, through an extended
series of newly-devised experiments, has conclusively
proved that none of the theories advanced are supported by
demonstrable facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Our present thorough knowledge of the combined disturbances
and phenomena, that play their part in the vessels
and tissues, of the body during the inflammatory action in
living tissue is due to the unremitting toil of Professor
Cohnheim. He was the first to speak from facts, as they
presented themselves to his eye under the microscope. It
was he who had the genius that suggested the examination
of the whole process of inflammation, in the living tissues
under the microscope. This he accomplished by narcotizing
a frog, and while alive, but insensible to pain, a portion of
the peritoneum or mesentery, which is almost transparent,
so that the circulation may be plainly seen, was fastened
with pins upon an ingeniously-devised rack or stage. The
inflammation is now excited by etching the membrane with
a little acid and a sharp needle, and then the object is placed
under the microscope. If the operator is careful, so as not
to tear or crush the vessels or tissues, and preserves the
moisture, by spraying with warm water from time to time,
the circulation and the abnormal processes of inflammation
that are going on, may be observed and studied with great
exactness for several hours. I will now describe what may
be seen in the field of the microscope.</p>

<p>The first change to be observed is in the vascular system
and within the vessels themselves; this begins with a
widening of the small arteries, then of the smaller capillaries
and veins. This increases the current of blood with greater
velocity through the widened vessels. Sooner or later this
rapidity of the current lessens; there is a marked slowness
to be observed in the stream. The single or separate blood
cells, which in the beginning of the observation could not be
distinguished, can now be distinctly seen, especially in the
veins and small capillaries, in which, from the slowness of
the current, the blood accumulates. In the veins there now
appears at the periphery of the current a pellucid plasmatic
layer, in which there are white blood cells, that have separated
themselves from the main current; the white cells either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
float slowly along or adhere to the walls of the vessels. This
phenomenon the Germans term “Randstellung der Farblosen
Blut Körperchen,” which means, bordering of white
blood corpuscles. Not long after the “bordering” of white
cells, a change takes place in the cells themselves, that is
very interesting. The white cells become elongated and
spear-shaped at one extremity, which pierces the wall of the
vessel, and after a little while the sharp extremities will
appear on the outer surface of the wall of the vessel, and
a little later on, indeed, the entire protoplasmic cell will
have emigrated into the tissue, outside of the vessel. Or, in
other words, the colorless blood cells will have passed through
the walls of the vein or capillary, and this constitutes an
<i>extravasation</i>.</p>

<p>The first extravasated cells will soon be followed by others
in great quantity, so that in six to eight hours veins and
capillaries are surrounded with white corpuscles. In their
normal destination these become organized into fibrous or
granulation tissue; and for this reason, an organ that is the
seat of chronic inflammation becomes immensely enlarged
from this inflammatory accretion. We can now readily appreciate
why the womb, liver or kidneys become augmented
in size from inflammatory processes. Indeed, this applies to
all growths and even to bone, and if a part is injured by a
cut, accident or disease of some sort, precisely the same processes
are at work to repair the lost tissue. It cannot fail to
become apparent at once, that to understand the phenomena
of inflammation is to possess the key that opens to our understanding
the operations not only of most diseases, but of
the healing processes of wounds and injuries. In the course
of the experiment we see also red blood corpuscles transude,
which are always accompanied with more or less fluid or
plasma.</p>

<p>The above detailed account seems to explain in a clear
manner the different cardinal symptoms that have become
recognized features of inflammation since the time of Galen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
The great vascular activity explains the redness, swelling
and increased temperature. The pain can be traced to the
pressure from the exudation, to which the delicate nerve filaments
were exposed, while lessened function would be the
natural result of nerves or tissues so compromised.</p>

<p>I made an attempt to initiate the reader into the science
of inflammatory processes and if I have succeeded in making
myself understood, then I am satisfied with having imparted
a most useful lesson, because there is no process in
the entire field of disease that is so general; it is almost safe
to say that with the exception of functional diseases, there
is perhaps no class of diseases with which an inflammatory
process is not more or less associated. This is true of consumption,
which is an inflammatory process excited by and
around the bacilli or micro-organisms, and these inflammatory
nodules are called tubercles. The growth of a cancerous
tumor is associated with an inflammation. The
development of a common boil is an illustration of an inflammation,
breaking down or destroying part of the tissue which
is inflamed. It is the same in inflammation of the lungs
or pneumonia as it is in ordinary catarrh; the differences
that are presented to the eye are only modifications of degree
and peculiarities that are due to the difference of the
tissues of which the organ or membrane is composed.</p>

<p class="pch">URETHRITIS AND NEURALGIA OF THE URETHRA.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inflammation</span> of the canal by which the urine is conducted
and discharged from the bladder is termed urethritis.</p>

<p>There is no organ of the female anatomy that is oftener
the seat of local inflammation.</p>

<p>The acute and chronic inflammations that affect the
male urethra, also affect that of the female, only perhaps to
a more limited extent, owing to the comparative smaller mucous
surface of the tube, it being only from an inch to an
inch and a half in length.</p>

<p>Inflammation is oftener confined to this portion of the
urinary apparatus than is generally supposed, because any
derangements of these parts is at once attributed to the
bladder, and it is an actual fact that many women have doctored
uselessly for years, for the one, when it was the other
that was diseased. Symptoms of urethral inflammations are
so very similar to inflammations of the bladder that the
points of distinction are easily overlooked.</p>

<p>The trouble begins with frequent desire to void urine
and a continual bearing down or straining sensation, which
may be accompanied with a sense of heat suggesting to the
minds of the most chaste and pure women, sexual desire,
which the gratification of that indulgence does not relieve
nor satiate, but, on the contrary, the sexual passion becomes
only exaggerated. It is only the strongest force of character
and Christian fortitude that keep some of these unfortunate
women in the path of rectitude and virtue, and it is
only the scientific specialist who can appreciate the real
cause. In many instances women, truly noble in character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
have fallen from their high estate, because uncontrollable
impulses swept them into the maelstrom of licentiousness,
which might have been averted, if they had known of whom
to seek proper advice.</p>

<p>This irritation is often innocently and ignorantly acquired
in early girlhood by fingering the parts, or practicing
masturbation, which sets up an inflammatory condition of
the urethra that becomes chronic, and in time may entail the
terrible consequences to which I have already alluded. For
that reason mothers should not be over-delicate; they should
not only keep a watchful eye on their children when in seclusion,
but should make it their holy duty to gradually initiate
their children into a knowledge of physiology and of
the diseases that may result from any violation of youthful
virtue.</p>

<p>Why is it that many children who have been reared in
an atmosphere of sanctity, children who have enjoyed from
their earliest recollection moral and spiritual administration,
have fallen into vice and depravity? The reader should
stop to answer this question for herself, while I too will answer
it for her.</p>

<p>It is because moral teachers overlook the fact that human
beings are dual; that we are all animal, however spiritual,
and that the functions of the animal nature must be understood
in order that the spiritual nature can control them.</p>

<p>A false delicacy has entirely neglected this part of the
education of our children, which I stamp as the height of
stupidity and hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Among other causes of this malady is hot and acrid
urine, or gravelly discharges from the bladder, cutting and
irritating the mucous membrane in its passage; abrasions
of this nature often lay the foundation for ulcers. When
the urine is in that condition, it is probably due to a complication
of diseases of the bladder, the kidneys and the liver.
A chemical and microscopical examination of the urine will
be the only means of settling these questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The urethra often takes on the inflammations of the
neighboring tissue or organs; disease of the vulva or of the
vagina will spread itself to the urinary canal. I have seen
cases in which the whole trouble was traceable to a catarrh
of the neck of the womb.</p>

<p>Gonorrhœal infection of the vagina will in the great
majority of cases extend itself to the urethra as well as to
the cavity of the womb and neighboring organs.</p>

<p>If treatment in these complicated cases is to be successful,
it must be directed to the disease in all of its strongholds;
this, of course, can only be done under the direction of a
skillful specialist.</p>

<p>There is a predisposition on the part of the mucous surfaces
to become infected by eruptions of the eruptive fevers,
and the urethra is particularly liable to this invasion.
Children who have had the measles and scarlet fever will
often be troubled with frequent and smarting micturition
and after convalescence from all the other symptoms of the
respective fevers, they are still more or less annoyed for weeks
or months with a urethritis. I have had cases of this nature
that dated back years. If the early treatment is neglected
and the case becomes chronic, it generally spreads to the
bladder, which also becomes similarly affected.</p>

<p>Smallpox pustules are apt to break out in the urethra
during the acute stage of the disease, and excite a very
itching and painful urethritis. Dysentery in children may
give rise to the disease. In adults I have noticed the affection
in connection with typhoid fever, but this generally
passes off with convalescence. Hemorrhoids or piles give
rise to urethral inflammation which does not yield to treatment,
but subsides at once after the removal of the piles.
The application of a Spanish-fly blister to any part of the
body may also cause a stranguary or a urethritis.</p>

<p>Mothers may become uneasy, as to the cause of the muco-purulent
discharge from the urethra of their little girls. I
have known them to entertain suspicion of some specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
infection being introduced into the genitals, in some mysterious
manner; a little inquiry into the history of every case,
dispels these absurd delusions, and it will be found that pinworms
have caused the inflammation. In adults, however,
the subject should be made the object of particular inquiry.
During delivery, the passage of the child’s head exerts great
pressure on the urethra, so that it may be crushed or torn
across. Women may be troubled with derangement from
this cause for a long time, or for their whole lives, if the
real cause of their ailment is not recognized. Displacements
of the womb in different directions, principally when
it is tipped backwards so that its neck impinges on the
urethra or neck of the bladder, compresses the canal, so that
its caliber is diminished, and a painful obstruction and retention
of urine ensue.</p>

<p>Papillated growths and mucous polypoids that were so
small that they were hidden from external sight, but readily
detected by scientific methods of examination of the urethra,
by means of the urethral specula, were the exciting causes
of some cases that came under my treatment. The unfortunate
victims were under the impression that their kidneys
or their bladders were diseased. The numerous quack
medicines advertised for the cure of these maladies were
copiously consumed, doing, of course, more mischief than
good. The removal of the growths in each instance at once
put a stop to any further inconvenience.</p>

<p>In pregnancy, after the third month, the womb rises
out of the pelvis, so as to accommodate its increasing size.
This naturally drags the bladder upwards, and so stretches
the urethra that it becomes sore and extremely irritable.
To relieve this distress until the parts have accommodated
themselves to their new relations, the Femina vaginal capsules
are of the greatest value, and without the slightest ill
effect arising from their use. Vaginal irrigations of hot
water are also of decided benefit, especially before using a
capsule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix. A teaspoonful to be given to an adult every four
hours till relieved.</p>

<p>The symptoms of inflammation of the urethra are always
very pronounced, because the mucous membrane of
the urethra is the most sensitive part of the bladder. In
the healthy state the coloring of the lining membrane is of
a pale red; when inflamed or catarrhal, it assumes a dark
red, or a cherry color. The membrane is also considerably
swelled and puffed, and feels hot to the touch, and imparts
a burning sensation to the patient. The muco-purulent secretion
excoriates or chafes the skin, so that the parts look
angry and red in the neighborhood; this is oftener observed
in children. The characteristic symptom of frequently urinating
is never absent, while very little is passed at a time,
yet the straining to pass water continues, after the last drop
is voided.</p>

<p>The treatment is cleanliness to begin with. In grown
people, the entire vulva and vagina must be rinsed out with
a warm borax solution, in the proportion of one teaspoonful
of the powdered borax dissolved in a quart of water.
In little children the same object, that of cleanliness, is to
be accomplished with a small ear syringe.</p>

<p>After the external parts and the vagina are thoroughly
cleansed, then, by means of a hard rubber syringe, No. 1,
three or four syringefuls of clean borax water are injected
into the urethra for the purpose of cleaning that too. To
relieve the straining and frequent desire to micturate, which
is accompanied with more or less pain, I give:&mdash;</p>

anything but salt; and alcoholic liquors, wine or beer must
also be suspended for the time being.</p>

<p class="psh">NEURALGIA OF THE URETHRA.</p>

<p>The female urethra is sometimes the seat of simple neuralgia,
by which is meant a painful condition in which
there is no apparent disease or inflammation of the tissues.</p>

<p>This pain assumes often a spasmodic character; that
there is a cause for this is certain, but it is as a rule remote
from the sensation which attracts attention. It is often
found to be the symptom of some of the diseases to which I
have already referred. These are ulcerations, displacements,
or inflammation and congestion of the neighboring organs.
Abnormal growths or tissues will often be painfully reflected
on the nerves of the urethra. I remember a case of internal
hemorrhoids, which was never suspected by the patient because
there were no painful symptoms pointing to the rectum,
but in which the urethra was very painful in its entire
extent. The suffering from this urethral neuralgia had
lasted for years, but disappeared at once, on the removal of
the piles. I have called attention to a catarrhal inflammation
of the urethra, from stretching occasioned by the ascending
womb after the third month of pregnancy; there is a
similar pathological process after the seventh month of gestation,
when the pregnant womb begins to descend again into
the pelvic cavity, and this is particularly marked in the pregnancy
with the first child, when the pain is often very severe.</p>

<p>If in a first pregnancy there is no abnormal disproportion
between the dimensions of the child’s head and the
maternal pelvis, or if there be no abnormal position of the
child, then there is an obstetric rule that the womb, or
rather the child’s head, begins to descend into the pelvis after
the seventh month of gestation, so that it can accommodate
or conform itself to the maternal parts. This occasions a
drag on the urethra downwards and backwards, which is
painfully annoying, and there is a constant inclination to
pass water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two mechanical methods of relieving this distressing
symptom; one is to obtain as much rest as possible
in the recumbent position, and the other is to wear an abdominal
supporter or bandage around the lower abdominal
region, so as to take the weight off the urethra. The internal
medication consists of an occasional dose of a mild
laxative medicine.</p>

<p>In the newly married, the urethra becomes sometimes
the seat of a painful spasmodic contraction; this is due to a
tense hymen, which should be slightly nicked with a pair
of scissors. Exposures to colds will also cause neuralgia.
Fresh beer and sour wine make the urine irritating, and
also occasion painful symptoms.</p>

<p>A thorough examination of the mucous membrane of
the urethra which does not reveal any inflammatory condition
or abnormal growth, establishes its neuralgic character.
The next step will naturally be to make such a careful examination
of all the surrounding tissues and organs, for the
purpose of ferreting out the real cause. When the cause is
removed or cured, it will also relieve the urethral pain. In
the absence of a clear comprehension of the true nature of
the malady, the treatment must be palliative. The sitz-bath
is always one of the most palliative measures for all sorts of
pelvic pains and aches. Vaginal injections of hot water,
not too hot, from 105 degrees to 108 degrees, are another
sort of general panacea,&mdash;the quantity of fluid should be
large, from half to one gallon, in which a teaspoonful of
pulverized borax has been dissolved. If the pain is very
severe, then a Femina vaginal capsule should be used every
night before retiring, and immediately after having used
the vaginal irrigation. The bed should always be previously
warmed with a hot bottle, unless it is very warm
weather.</p>

<p>If the urine is irritating, a cupful of buchu tea three or
four times a day, or German chamomile tea, should be drunk
between meals. If these measures do not give relief, then
consult an honest, competent physician, in whose integrity
you can rely.</p>

<p class="pch">INFLAMMATION, CATARRH, AND OTHER DISORDERS
OF THE BLADDER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> female bladder is easier approached than that of the
male. This is clearly illustrated in the anatomical Plate II,
which should be thoroughly studied before this chapter is
read.</p>

<p>The bladder lies directly behind the symphysis pubis,
above or in front of the vagina. On account of the comparative
shortness of the female urethra, to that of the male,
the cavity of the bladder is also much more accessible
through this channel, and if access through this communication
does not suffice, then the interior of the female bladder
may be exposed by an incision through the anterior
wall of the vagina, but this resource becomes rarely necessary.
Formerly we had to content ourselves with external
appearances, that were confined to the external anatomy of
the urinary canal on the anterior vaginal wall, aided only
by a delicate sense of touch. Valuable as these means of
examination sometimes were, they were far from satisfactory
to either physician or patient. Now we are able to examine
with the finger, aided with the eyes, almost the entire lining
of the bladder.</p>

<p>Professor Simon, of Heidelberg, was the inventive genius of
this improved method of examination, by means of a series
of graded specula or hard rubber bougies, which are known
by his name. The specula are simply small, smooth, pin-shaped,
hard rubber bougies, about three inches in length,
beginning with a size that is three-tenths of an inch in diameter,
to the largest, which is eight-tenths of an inch in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
thickness. These are carefully introduced into the urethra,
commencing with the smallest size, which is retained for a few
minutes and then withdrawn, and the next size inserted, and
this continued until the largest one has been inserted, or the
required dilatation accomplished, either for the purpose of introducing
the finger into the bladder, or exposing its lining
membrane for inspection. While this procedure does not fall
into the sphere of home treatment, it is of sufficient interest
to women in general that they should know what can actually
be accomplished by the expert specialist. Were I to
review the malformations, or dislocations, of the bladder, or
the history of stones in the bladder, or other foreign bodies,
that the female specialist is very seldom called upon to treat,
I should only worry the patience of the reader with things
that she would not readily understand. The same is true
of growths and tumors of the bladder, which have principally
a scientific interest for the practitioner of medicine,
but for the casual reader they are too profound in their details
for a clear understanding.</p>

<p class="psh">INFLAMMATION.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the bladder is in medical language
termed cystitis. It presents itself under two varieties or subdivisions,
<i>acute</i> and chronic, depending on the duration,
whether recent or protracted.</p>

<p>The disease begins in the mucous membrane, and the
acute inflammation comes on suddenly. It rarely occupies
the entire mucous surface of the bladder, but usually occurs
in irregular spots. Some spots are as large as the palm of
the hand, while others are only the size of a ten-cent piece.
The parts that are most frequently affected, are the neck of
the bladder and its posterior wall, although no portion of
its lining membrane is exempt from inflammation.</p>

<p>It rarely happens that the inflammation spreads over
the entire extent of the bladder, or that it invades the muscular
tissue; if it should complicate the latter, it would involve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the peritoneum; this would add a very serious complication,
namely, a peritonitis. Cystitis may be due to an extension
of gonorrhœal infection from the vagina and urethra, or
from other purulent affections. Women who are unable to
pass water after confinement, may be liable to the disease
from retained urine, decomposing in the bladder and causing
inflammation. On the other hand, a filthy catheter
used by a midwife or doctor who is careless or ignorant of
the necessary antiseptic precautions, and who fails to brush
and boil out the catheters, and uses one catheter on different
patients, without the precaution of even thoroughly
rinsing it, may give rise to dangerous cystitis. The most
serious case that I ever have seen was directly traceable to
this cause. If impure air gets into the bladder this will also
excite cystitis; to prevent that, is to close with the finger the
outlet of the catheter that is used for drawing off the urine,
when withdrawing the instrument, a precaution seldom observed.</p>

<p>Newly-brewed malt liquors, alcoholic stimulants taken
in excess, diuretics of spirits of turpentine and cantharis,
or highly-seasoned and rich food, are among the exciting
causes; irritating injections into the bladder or vagina, and
even cold-water injections into the vagina, must be added as
exciting causes of this painful affection. Venereal excesses
operate in exciting visceral inflammation, and when the
slightest symptoms are felt, prudence and good common
sense dictate continence. The first feeling that manifests itself
is a dull, heavy, aching sensation, immediately after urinating,
and an involuntary inclination to further relieve or
empty the bladder by pressing or bearing down. Soon after
the first indication to void urine, there is another desire to
empty the bladder, and the same symptoms repeat themselves,
only in a more aggravated form. The distress of
micturition gradually becomes continuous so that during the
short intervals between the times that urine is voided, and
as the disease progresses, the pain becomes sharper. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
accompanied by a kind of gnawing uneasiness in the region
of the whole bladder, which has intermissions, but is greatly
increased when the desire to make water is felt. If the disease
progresses, the pain is now felt in the neighboring organs
and a general constitutional disturbance manifests itself.
The patient will now generally have a severe chill;
this is followed with heat and thirst and an increase in the
pulse. The desire to void urine at shorter intervals becomes
more prominent and only drop by drop, accompanied with
distressing spasm and a burning sensation along the urinary
canal.</p>

<p>The region of the bladder becomes in the advanced stages
of inflammation extremely sensitive and tender, and if the
peritoneum is involved, even the weight of the bedclothes
becomes intolerable. The limbs are drawn up and the body
is inclined forward to relieve the tension of the abdominal
muscles and their pressure on the bladder.</p>

<p>The neighboring organs begin to sympathize with the
advanced state of the inflammation at this stage; cutting
pains are felt in the rectum, while darts of pain shoot from
the bladder towards the groins and ovaries.</p>

<p>Owing to the spasmodic action of the urethra, the bladder
is never completely emptied so that the urine gradually accumulates
in abnormal proportions; the retained urea rapidly
decomposes into ammonia and the urine becomes very
hot and irritating, thus greatly augmenting the suffering.
Under these circumstances, the bladder may become greatly
distended and feel as a sensitive globular tumor above the
pubis. The retention of the urine may be complete, owing
to a partial paralysis of the bladder and now complicated
with spasmodic stricture. Nausea and vomiting are rarely
absent in this stage, the tongue becomes coated and dry,
while the expression is anxious and the fever very high.</p>

<p>In the commencement of the disease there is some difference
in the symptoms of inflammation of the bladder which
arises from the nature and seat of the inflammatory process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>If the neck of the bladder is mainly affected, the spasmodic
desire to urinate is more pronounced, and the pain is
felt low down in the vagina and anus, while the symptoms
are higher up in the rectum, with constant inclination to go
to stool, if the base or posterior wall of the organ is principally
involved.</p>

<p>Acute cystitis runs its course in six or eight days; under
favorable circumstances and appropriate treatment all painful
symptoms will in that time have subsided, and the patient
will have entered upon a course of permanent recovery.</p>

<p>If through a constitutional habit, or through neglect or
improper treatment, the disease is not curbed, the result
will be quite different; the inflammation may pass into a
suppurative stage or assume the chronic form.</p>

<p>The treatment in the acute stage will resolve itself into
two different measures of relief; these are first to subdue the
spasmodic pain and nervous excitement, and secondly, to
quiet the local irritation. The pain is best controlled by
morphine powders, one-fourth of a grain each, given every
four hours. Warm teas of German chamomile or flaxseed,
so as to dilute the urine, may be freely given. Hot vaginal
injections of borax water have a remarkably soothing influence;
the hot sitz-bath is another useful adjuvant. It has
been customary in this country and England, to apply hot
water compresses or hot poultices over the <i>hypogastrium</i>,
which is that part of the lower abdomen corresponding to
the region of a distended bladder.</p>

<p>After eight years of extended experience in this country,
and a thorough trial of hot fomentations for inflammatory
affections of the abdomen, I became convinced that the German
method of cold-water compresses gives more relief and
is more in the nature of an <i>abortive</i>, hence curative.</p>

<p>I recommend to my patients, instead of the hot-water
applications, a rubber bag, filled with broken pieces of ice,
and applied over the region of the bladder.</p>

<p>The bowels should be freely moved with castor oil or a
dose of salts and senna, or by an enema of warm soapsuds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The food should be bland and of a fluid nature as nearly
as possible, broths with an egg, milk gruels or bread and
milk.</p>

<p class="psh">CHRONIC CYSTITIS.</p>

<p>If the acute attack of cystitis in the course of eight or
ten days becomes modified, but convalescence is not established,
then it is quite probable that the disease is drifting
into a <i>chronic</i> stage.</p>

<p>The mucus or slime that formerly accompanied the
urinary discharge is now assuming the character of matter
or has become muco-purulent. While this is a very rare
symptom of the acute variety of cystitis and usually of brief
duration, in chronic inflammation it is one of the characteristics
of the malady, and often lasts for a long time; the
muco-purulent fluid is occasionally remarkably profuse.</p>

<p>The pus is not always furnished by the free surface of
the mucous membrane, but may be traced to small abscesses,
situated in the tissue between the mucous membrane and
the muscular wall of the bladder. The locality for the formation
of these abscesses is principally at the neck of the
organ, although there is no part of the organ that is entirely
exempt from them. Fortunately, the abscesses generally
point inwards or towards the cavity of the bladder, but it
not infrequently happens that they break through and empty
into the vagina or even into the adjacent bowel or abdominal
cavity.</p>

<p>The occurrence of pus or suppuration is by itself so
grave a process that it is always accompanied with certain
well marked and stereotyped symptoms, which are cold
chills, alternating with flushes of heat, increase of heat or
fever, anxiety and restlessness. The pain now becomes dull
and throbbing in character, and the burning or stinging is
only felt when the patient urinates. When there are abscesses,
the nervous derangement may be so great as to
cause the mind to wander in delirium. Before the appearence
of pus in the urine, nothing but a skillful examination
can establish the existence of an abscess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The treatment for suppuration of the bladder, when
limited to the surface of the mucous membrane, is always
curable with intelligently-directed treatment, which is the
same as that for chronic catarrh of the bladder, to be detailed
further on.</p>

<p class="psh">ULCERATION OF THE BLADDER.</p>

<p>This is perhaps seldom a condition by itself, but rather a
complication of the preceding disease. The ulcers occupy
the place of what were formerly little abscesses, that have
broken into the cavity of the organ. Foreign bodies in the
bladder by their direct pressure on the delicate tissues of the
membrane have been the cause of ulcerations, that gave
rise to dangerous hemorrhage. Earthy concretions or stones
will naturally form in the bladder, and the end of a gum
catheter has also been found in the bladder broken off in the
bungling act of drawing off the urine, or, what is more
likely, by boring and poking within the cavity of the bladder,
with a catheter or bougie, by persons ignorant of pelvic
anatomy or in the belief that the bougie was in the cavity
of the womb, for the purpose of inducing an abortion.</p>

<p>Ulcerations will always be accompanied with more or
less inflammation or visceral catarrh, so that the symptoms
will fall under that head which has already been considered.</p>

<p class="psh">CATARRH OR SUBACUTE INFLAMMATION.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane of the bladder, like that of the
nose, mouth or bronchial tubes, has its natural secretion of
healthy mucous. When any of these membranes become
irritated or congested from any cause, this natural secretion
becomes so increased as to make a perceptible <i>flow</i> of the
secretion of mucus, and this is what the term <i>catarrh</i> signifies.
Catarrhs always presuppose the existence of inflammation,
which in its nature is subdued or mild, so that it
has been qualified as subacute, which is intended to convey
the idea that the tissue need not be red nor hot and swollen
as is always the case in the acute form of inflammation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Chronic catarrh of the bladder is traceable to any or all
the causes that have been enumerated in the acute processes,
because every acute inflammation of the bladder may terminate
in a chronic form. It occurs at any period of life, but
it is most common in elderly subjects; it is always an attendant
of ulceration of the bladder or some abnormal
growth in the bladder. If the disease is once established and
is due to a complication, it is liable to become aggravated or
re-established after a brief subsidence by exposure to cold,
excesses in diet and drink, or diseases of the vagina, uterus
or rectum.</p>

<p>The secretion of catarrh is white and glairy and resembles
the discharge of leucorrhœa or whites. When disassociated
with acute inflammation of the bladder, it comes on
gradually, or in a slow, insidious manner; for this reason
the term subacute inflammation is sometimes employed by
authors, because there are no fiery symptoms at the onset of
the affection.</p>

<p>The urine is always more or less altered in character,
because the inflamed mucous membrane predisposes the
urine to speedy decomposition. There is frequent and difficult
micturition, and the entire region, but in particular the
affected organ, is more or less sensitive and sore.</p>

<p>The quantity of mucus which passes off with the urine
varies greatly at different periods and in different cases.
In the early stages it may entirely escape notice, being so
small that if the urine is not saved in a vessel and accumulated
for the twenty-four hours the mucus can hardly
be detected; thus, the entire quantity of the above period
may often not exceed two teaspoonfuls. When the disease
becomes more advanced, the quantity of mucus may be
equal to the quantity of urine that passes. The secretion is
very thick and sticky, and settles to the bottom of the vessel
or adheres to its surface. If there is pus mixed with the
mucous secretion, it becomes a more serious question, and it
may then be inferred that other organs are involved, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
conductors of urine from the kidneys to the bladder, for
instance, or the kidneys themselves. If the disease is confined
to the bladder, the prospects for a cure are very favorable;
only when diseases of other organs in the neighborhood
are the exciting causes of the malady are the chances
for a cure correspondingly limited.</p>

<p>The success of any treatment will depend in a great
measure upon the nature of the exciting causes. These require
to be removed, if within the possibility of medical
skill, before the catarrh can be made to subside.</p>

<p>Should the mucous or muco-purulent secretion be very
abundant, the bladder must be thoroughly rinsed out; first
once every twenty-four hours, and afterwards every other
day, so that the mucous membrane will be cleansed from
all foreign irritating elements. I am employing for this
purpose Thiersche’s Boro-Salicylic solution. This of course
can only be carried out by a skillful physician.</p>

<p>When the disease is in its incipient stage it is amenable
to intelligently-directed home treatment.</p>

<p>The most perfect rest of mind and body is one of the
essentials to success, the entire suspension of stimulating
drinks of an alcoholic nature, of which beer is the most
irritating, and tea or coffee must be discarded. A milk
and vegetable diet is the most beneficial to subsist on, and
all condiments, even salt, must be dispensed with.</p>

<p>If the bowels are costive they must be regulated either
by means of enemas of warm water, or what may prove of
greater and more lasting benefit is the use of Femina laxative
tablets. One tablet should be taken every night at bedtime,
and if one operates too much, then one every other
night may be all that is required.</p>

<p>Demulcent drinks of flaxseed tea, or slippery-elm water,
should be drunk freely, and for the catarrh of the bladder
there is no prescription that ever gave me the same satisfactory
results as this one:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh">NEURALGIA AND NERVOUS IRRITABILITY.</p>

<p>The bladder is often the seat of functional derangements
that are characterized by a morbid sensibility and pain.</p>

<p>The principal symptom of this disease is a frequent desire
to urinate. A careful examination of the urine reveals
nothing abnormal in the fluid that would point to the
slightest affection of the bladder, nor are any of the symptoms
that characterize inflammation present. There is no
mucous sediment, but in a large proportion of cases there is
an abnormal deposit of the phosphates that would point to
nerve waste. There is often a similar irritability in the
vaginal canal, in fact, there is such a mutual sympathy between
the two, which can hardly be located in any one particular
organ.</p>

<p>Hemorrhoids and constipation are sometimes found to be
the cause.</p>

<p>In women of a nervous temperament the bladder often
becomes the seat of a steady neuralgic pain. Sometimes
this pain is periodical, recurring every day and about the
same hour and lasting the same period. This pain is of a
lancinating character, and radiates from the bladder to the
neighboring organs. I have noticed these symptoms, particularly
in women who had lived in malarial districts, and
whose blood had become impoverished by malarial fevers,
or from excessive hemorrhages due to some uterine trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Sexual excesses and other abuses that lower the tone of
the nervous system will also develop a neuralgic condition
of these parts. Persons who seek relief from this distressing
complaint must first abandon their vices before they can
expect alleviation from any treatment. This affection is
not in itself dangerous, but the frequent recurrence of paroxysms
of pain render life miserable. If the general system
requires toning up, I would recommend the iron pills after
Formula I, with a good liberal diet of eggs and milk. For
immediate relief of the painful spasms, the sitz-bath and
hot vaginal injections are of great value. And for the irritable
bladder I can recommend:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The gouty and rheumatic bladder is so very rare that a
detailed description is hardly necessary. But it might be
well to remind the reader that if she is of a gouty or rheumatic
disposition and has also bladder trouble, it may be
due to the bladder being compromised or influenced by
gout or rheumatism. In that case, appropriate treatment
directed to the rheumatic diathesis will also cure the bladder.</p>

<p class="psh">PARALYSIS.</p>

<p>The female bladder becomes paralyzed from various
causes; some of these are located in the organ itself, while
others are due to disease of the brain or spinal cord. An
obstruction to the flow of urine through the urethra causes
the bladder to become overdistended with urine and induces
paralysis. A prolonged pressure from the child’s
head during delivery is oftener the cause of transient paralysis
than any other. It happens that lying-in women cannot
pass their urine for several days after confinement.
Violence from without, as a blow or a kick, may have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
similar effect. This results from the pressure to which the
bladder was subjected. Operations on the rectum, vagina,
or any of the pelvic organs, are frequently followed by a
partial or complete paralysis. In all these cases, there is
only one precaution to observe, and that is to draw off the
urine at regular intervals so as to avoid an enormous accumulation
of fluid.</p>

<p>The paralysis becomes dangerous and obstinate to treatment,
in proportion as the bladder becomes abnormally distended,
and the length of time that the muscular tissues are
under the excessive strain.</p>

<p>In those cases where the paralysis is due to spinal or
brain disease, there is little prospect of a cure. In other
cases, as for instance after confinement or an operation on
the rectum for piles or fistula, it generally passes off in a
few days.</p>

<p>Great care and cleanliness must be exercised in using
the catheter, so that the bladder is not infected from filth or
virus from another patient. A catheter that has been employed
on a patient who had her urine drawn off while she
suffered from purulent catarrh or puerperal fever, will inoculate
a healthy person with the same disease, and in this
manner diseases are often communicated. The bladder is
exceedingly liable to infection.</p>

<p class="psh">HEMORRHAGE.</p>

<p>A discharge of blood from the bladder is not of frequent
occurrence, but it occurs often enough to make it noteworthy,
and women should at least know that there is such a thing.
It oftener takes place in men than in women, as a symptom
of some grave or serious disease, or it may be only a trivial
disorder. Hemorrhage of the mucous membrane takes place
very readily, owing to the delicacy of the tissues and the great
vascularity of the submucous layer, and there is a much greater
tendency to hemorrhage in some persons than in others.</p>

<p>Persons who are weak and debilitated bleed much easier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
than strong, vigorous ones, because the blood may become
so thin or poor in fibrin that it greatly loses its property of
coagulating. Some diseases bring this particular diathesis
about, such as scurvy, also measles, scarlatina or smallpox.
Worms have been found to make their way from the
rectum into the cavity of the bladder, and caused profuse
and even fatal hemorrhage. A violent fall of the body,
rupturing an artery in the bladder, severe horseback riding,
and venereal excesses, have all caused almost fatal hemorrhages,
to which must be added ulceration of the mucous
membrane. The most profuse hemorrhage of the bladder
that I was ever called upon to witness, followed drinking a
strong decoction of wormwood; irritating diuretics, like
spirits of turpentine or tincture of cantharides, are also liable
to cause bleeding. Hemorrhage is always accompanied
with frequent desire to pass urine and spasmodic pains at
the neck of the bladder. The blood may also coagulate in
the bladder, causing an obstruction. The treatment consists
principally in keeping the patient very quiet, and a
rubber ice bag should be applied over the region of the
bladder; nothing but bland liquid food is advisable, but no
hot drinks are permissible. If the urine does not pass, a
soft rubber catheter should be employed for the purpose of
drawing it off.</p>

bladder, the bowels or lungs, generally yield to the following

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The situation of the female bladder, just in front and
over the vagina, and also its attachment to a portion of the
cervix or neck of the womb, exposes it to injuries, especially
from pressure of the child’s head during delivery. By referring
to Plate II, it will be seen at a glance how easily
an accident can take place from this cause. It was at one
time supposed that delivery by forceps was the most fruitful
cause of this lesion. That this is likely to happen only
where the instrument is in incompetent or bungling hands,
there is no reasonable doubt. A thorough acquaintance
with the entire subject has proved that there are other
causes that are the mainspring of this, sometimes very serious
accident.</p>

<p>Indeed, the opposite view is now entertained by the profession;
that is, that prompt delivery by forceps will prevent
the parts from being injured, when the soft parts, and particularly
the bladder, is under severe and prolonged pressure
by the child’s head. There is no question that there is
greater peril to the mother and child, in undecisive delay,
provided the attendant has the requisite judgment and experience
to act intelligently.</p>

<p>The hypothesis upon which this is based is the restorative
property that living tissue possesses, to regain its vitality,
after it has been subjected to severe and inordinate
pressure. This we may observe in our daily experience;
when, for instance, we jamb or crush our finger, or a child
has its fingers momentarily crushed between a closing door,
the fingers are sometimes crushed flat, but upon being released,
they rapidly regain their shape and vitality. If the
pressure were continued for any length of time, the blood in
the tissues would have become congealed, and the circulation
permanently shut off, so that recuperation would have
been impossible, and the tissues would have sloughed or
mortified.</p>

<p>If the bladder, under the direct pressure of the child’s
head against the pubic bone, be subjected too long, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
same results would naturally follow: the tissues could not
regain their vitality, and they would either tear or subsequently
slough or mortify, which causes the <i>fistula</i>.</p>

<p>The vagina and bladder, like every other tissue of the
body, except that of the brain or nerves, will suffer a great
deal of contusion for a short time, but if protracted beyond
a reasonable length of time, it will be permanently destroyed
or injured.</p>

<p>A urinary fistula is always a serious malady, since it exercises
a deleterious influence upon the patient’s health. If
the opening is only small, a spontaneous cure may take
place, but if it reaches considerable dimensions, it requires
to be accurately adapted and stitched together. The best
time for the repair of the injury, is six to eight weeks after
the receipt of the injury.</p>

<p>Rupture of the female bladder is comparatively rare,
for the reason that women are not exposed to the same serious
accidents as men; but if women will persist in doing
everything that men ought to do for them, the statistics may
be reversed. When the bladder is distended and violence is
brought to bear on the abdominal walls, corresponding to
the region of the filled bladder, a rupture is likely to result.
Surgical measures should at once be resorted to, so that the
injury can be repaired before inflammation of the peritoneum
sets in.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">ACUTE AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE
VAGINA.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> speaking of inflammation of the vagina, reference
is had to its mucous lining alone. It undoubtedly happens
that structures or tissues beneath the mucous covering become
involved in the inflammatory action, but this occurs
so seldom that it is not of sufficient moment to make it the
subject of an inquiry in a practical work.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane of the vagina, like all other
mucous surfaces, has its natural secretion for the purpose of
lubricating and keeping its surface moist. In a perfectly
healthy state, the color of the vaginal mucous membrane is
a pale red, this becomes scarlet red upon irritation. In girls
who are not irritated or women who have not been abused
by sexual excesses nor infected by disease, the normal secretion
is just sufficient to preserve the moisture of its surfaces,
but not in such an excess as to be noticed as a secretion
or discharge outside of the vaginal canal. There is a physiological
exception to this normal rule, a few days before
and after the menstrual period, when the mucous membrane
of the vagina sympathizes with the general congestion of
the pelvic organs. The mucous secretion becomes then
greatly increased, amounting to a catarrh or flow, this, however,
is only transient and subsides with the cessation of
the menses. This might with propriety be termed a natural
or physiological catarrh.</p>

<p>For convenience of description and corresponding with
the anatomical changes and the sources of their origin, inflammation
of the mucous membrane of the vagina may
be <i>acute</i> or <i>chronic</i>, simple or specific.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Acute inflammation in this instance is no different in its
characteristic symptoms from inflammations elsewhere; it
develops suddenly, and there is congestive swelling and
pain. There is considerable heat in the parts, increased redness,
and the canal is very sensitive. In the beginning the
mucous membrane is dry and contracted, but after a few
hours or a day, relaxation and moisture supersede. The
secretion is very scant at first, but becomes more abundant
as the disease progresses, its character also changes from a
white, glairy mucus to a creamy, muco-purulent or yellowish
discharge. The urethra may also become involved, and then
the symptoms that were detailed in connection with urethritis
are also present.</p>

<p>Acute vaginitis may arise from a great variety of causes,
but the worst case that ever came under my notice was the
scalding effect of a hot-water injection, given under the advice
of a physician who had ordered the patient to use the
water “as hot as she could stand it,” and also told her “the
hotter the better.” This <i>profoundly wise</i> suggestion was
carried out by the patient with a vengeance, for she used
nearly boiling hot water, which she had tested by putting in
her finger and quickly withdrawing it. The steaming fluid
so scalded the vagina that a most pronounced acute inflammation
of the vagina was the immediate result. I have had
other cases of the chronic form come under my notice that
were aggravated by similar advice, so that a word of warning
against the thoughtless and indiscriminate use of hot-water
injections will not be without value.</p>

<p>The vaginal irrigations of hot water, as a general stimulant
to the mucous surfaces, or as an alterative to stimulate
the absorbents to increased activity in removing old pelvic
exudations, deserve a recognized place as a useful therapeutic
measure, often of the greatest value, but too hot or “as
hot as the patient can bear it,” is superlative nonsense and
absolutely injurious.</p>

<p>No water injections into the vagina that are kept up any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
length of time should be warmer than 110 degrees Fahr.
and never should vaginal injections be employed without
using a thermometer to gauge the heat. When the solution
is medicated, 103 degrees should be the average temperature,
but it should never exceed 107 degrees Fahr. Exposure to
cold and moisture especially during the menses is prominent
among the causes of acute vaginitis; injury from pessaries
or coition, retained putrefying secretions in the vagina,
or the application of chemical preparations, or injury during
confinement, will all induce this disease. Prolonged nursing
causes anæmia, which predisposes the system to catarrhs.
During the child-bearing period catarrhs of the vagina are
quite common, and excessive coition excites a very painful
inflammation of the vaginal mucous membrane.</p>

<p>Gonorrhœal infection arising from a specific contagion
gives rise to a very painful and dangerous vaginitis. The
character and nature of the specific virus admits of no particular
description, because its infectious quality of a specific
nature does not at all depend upon the physical appearance
of the infectious discharge from the male. Whether it is
yellow or greenish, muco-purulent or a glairy mucous discharge,
establishes no criterion, but the presence of microbes,
the <i>gonococcus</i> of Neisser; this, of course, a careful microscopic
examination can alone establish. This much is true,
that careful researches in Europe, by competent and reliable
authorities, have established the fact, from carefully-prepared
statistics, that this is a far more fruitful source of uterine
diseases than was formerly dreamed of.</p>

<p>A specific vaginitis has a greater tendency to spread itself
along the mucous tract of the genital organs of the female
than a simple non-specific catarrh. In the former the
womb and Fallopian tubes become successively affected, as
we shall learn more definitely when we have occasion to inquire
into the diseases peculiar to these organs.</p>

<p>Acute inflammation of the vagina has pronounced symptoms,
and when any one of them is felt by the patient, she
should lose no time in resorting to treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The first symptom that is generally perceived by the
patient is a sense of heat and burning in the vaginal canal;
this is also reflected in the neck of the bladder during micturition.
As the disease develops, there is a constant desire
to pass water frequently, and this becomes sometimes a
prominent sign. A dull aching weight is felt between the
vagina and rectum. After these have lasted for some days,
an offensive discharge from the vagina ushers in the second
stage, excoriating the skin around the vulva, and if the disease
should spread itself to the neighboring organs, there is
a violent throbbing pain in the whole pelvis.</p>

<p>Women who are suffering with acute painful vaginitis
should take to bed; all pelvic diseases of any acuteness at
all are treated at a great disadvantage when the patient is
running around and on her feet. The disturbance in the
circulation, the exposure to cold from cold floors or damp sidewalks,
and the impossibility of preserving an equable temperature
of the body, when out of bed, only aggravate the
malady.</p>

<p>The vagina is to be douched several times a day with
half gallon of warm water, in which a half teaspoonful or
one tablet of Femina antiseptic uterine lotion has been dissolved,
and when the canal is rinsed, a Femina vaginal capsule
should be introduced, but only once a day, and that is
preferable at bedtime. The feet and extremities should be
kept warm, and in married women total continence should
be observed while the slightest irritation and soreness exists.
By the non-observance of this precaution, the best directed
efforts will often be frustrated and many female diseases
which are readily curable in the beginning become chronic,
and a moment’s reflection ought to make this clear to any
person of ordinary intelligence.</p>

<p>If there is the slightest suspicion that the disease is of a
specific nature, the treatment must be antiseptic in its nature.
Your physician should be reminded of the possible
nature of the disease, for doctors as a rule are ignorant of
the dangers that ordinarily accompany gonorrhœal infection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Oppenheimer in Germany made experiments for testing
the germicidal properties of various drugs on the specific
germs of gonorrhœa, and he proved that a corrosive sublimate
solution of 1 part to 20,000 will kill the gonococci.
Corrosive sublimate is the corrosive chloride of mercury,
one of the most powerful of the mineral poisons, and while
it is perfectly safe in the dilutions that it is employed in, the
greatest precaution must be constantly exercised to keep the
drug isolated and out of the reach of children, especially
the “antiseptic tablets,” of which mention will be made below,
because little children and adults also might at first
sight believe that they were candy.</p>

<p>I am accustomed to employ the <i>corrosive sublimate</i> much
stronger than the Oppenheimer experiments demand, a practice
which I base upon practical observations, while in the
Berlin clinics, and that is in the proportion of 1 to 2,000.
John Wyeth &amp; Bro., of Philadelphia, and other manufacturing
chemists, make compressed tablets or wafers, which are
very convenient and easily handled by any person of average
understanding. These are sold by the druggists in little wide-mouth
bottles, properly labeled, so that the required strength,
1 to 2,000, is obtained by dissolving one or two according to
their strength in a half gallon of warm water. Whenever
gonorrhœa is suspected, the vagina should be thoroughly
rinsed out several times a day with the corrosive solution.
If the patient fears mercurial poisoning, the antiseptic irrigation
can be followed by plain warm-water rinsings as a safe
precaution against mercurial absorption.</p>

<p class="psh">CHRONIC CATARRH, LEUCORRHŒA OR WHITES.</p>

<p>An acute inflammation of the mucous membrane of any
organ may drift into the chronic or subacute form, so that
any of the causes which give rise to the acute variety are
among those that are to be looked for in chronic catarrh.
The general characteristics of catarrh are the same, whether
acute or chronic or whether located in the nose, throat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
bronchial tubes or vagina. This fact greatly simplifies the
whole subject of catarrhal inflammations, so that the general
reader will find no difficulty in acquiring the necessary
information for successful home treatment of this very
common class of diseases.</p>

<p>Chronic vaginal catarrh has been divided into two varieties,
<i>vaginal and uterine</i>. The distinction depends upon its
origin or complication. Vaginal catarrh has its origin in
and is limited to the vaginal canal. I have already called
attention to a purely physiological catarrh that accompanies
the menstrual flow and which subsides with the cessation of
the menses; in addition to this, there is probably no woman
who goes through life without at some time during her natural
existence having this disease or symptom. Often the
discharge is so scant that it entirely escapes her notice, and
not until it becomes annoying by its constancy and abundance
do women seek assistance.</p>

<p>In ancient times and until quite recently, it was considered
as a distinct disease, attributed to constitutional debility
or an indication of impure blood; these theories are
now entirely discarded. The modern school of Gynecology
has given it quite a different interpretation, and considers
leucorrhœa rather a symptom of some local disease than a
disease itself. Experience, and careful research in, the sick
chamber fully corroborate the correctness of this view, so
that a simple local chronic catarrh is the exception to the
rule. The exception applies oftener to children than to
adults. We find it in young babies or little girls of all ages
as a result of diarrhœal discharges which are acrid and
filter themselves into the vagina and by their sharp, irritating
action on the mucous membrane, excite at first an
acute, and afterwards a chronic catarrh of these parts.
Eruptive fevers have induced a similar effect upon the mucous
membrane of the child’s vagina and also upon that
of the bladder; obstinate catarrhs are frequently traced to
these fevers. I have known pinworms to make their way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
from the rectum into the vagina and by their irritating
presence excite in the little child a very distressing vaginal
catarrh.</p>

<p>The irritation or itching which the inflammation and
decomposed secretion cause, makes the child involuntarily
dig or scratch her vulva, which of course only aggravates
the disease, and which has already been mistaken for precocious
masturbation, and will undoubtedly often be so considered
again by superficial observers. In later years a
subacute inflammation of these parts will undoubtedly develop
this pernicious practice, and I have known several
cases myself where young girls became physical wrecks
from a combination of chronic vaginal catarrh and self-abuse,
no one ever dreaming of the real morbid condition,
but attributing their decline to everything else but the
right cause.</p>

<p>There is another complication that may arise from catarrhal
inflammation in little children, and that is an adhesive
inflammation of the vaginal walls; that means that
the sides of the vagina may partly or completely grow together,
and thus change the normal diameter of the vaginal
canal. In after years this may entail frightful suffering,
either by mechanically obstructing the escape of the menstrual
blood or otherwise interfering with the normal function
of the canal. There are many diseases from which we
suffer in adult life for which the foundation was laid when
we were young, through the ignorance of our parents.</p>

<p>The stormy symptoms that usher in the acute form are
absent in the development of the subacute or chronic variety.
This disease begins sometimes so insidiously that the
patient may not be aware of its existence for quite a while.
The secretion may not be at first changed in its character,
save that it is noticed in greater abundance. In the course
of time, the nature of the secretion will be greatly changed,
from a white glairy discharge into a grayish opaque secretion;
this will be tinged greenish some days and be of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
muco-purulent aspect. In the great majority of cases it is a
whitish cheesy discharge from which the names <i>leucorrhœa</i>
or <i>whites</i> have been derived.</p>

<p>The color of the vaginal mucous membrane in chronic
catarrh is of a bluish red tint, and its surface presents in
places granulated patches, that bleed easily when they are
touched. The vaginal walls are relaxed, so that women
often complain that they have a sensation of “feeling open;”
this is indeed the real state of affairs; the walls of the
vagina may become so relaxed as to constitute a prolapse
of the anterior portion or wall of the vagina, dragging the
bladder and womb down with it.</p>

<p>A great many of the so-called “<i>falling of the womb cases</i>”
are no falling of the womb at all but simply a relaxed vagina,
in which the wearing of pessaries or any other mechanical
uterine supporter will actually do a great deal of
harm.</p>

<p>The treatment of vaginal catarrh is principally local,
when there are no constitutional complications. Of course
there are rules of conduct that apply to all catarrhal patients,
whether the catarrh is of the genitalia, of the nose or
throat or of the bronchial tubes; these rules constitute the
hygiene of catarrh, a subject which is discussed in a separate
chapter in this work to which the intelligent reader is referred.</p>

<p>The main feature of the treatment consists in thorough
cleanliness of the vaginal canal and in the use of a soothing
lotion. This object is best accomplished by the use of the
Femina antiseptic lotion and in the following manner: Dissolve
one tablet or half a teaspoonful in a cupful of hot water
and then add this to a half gallon of warm water of a
temperature of 103° F., and by means of an elastic bulb syringe,
use the entire quantity at one time. If the discharge is
profuse, or if any offensive odor is perceptible, then the vaginal
injection should be made several times a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>In case there is soreness and pain in the pelvis, and
there generally is, a Femina vaginal capsule should be introduced
into the vagina, just before retiring.</p>

<p>When the patient feels a dragging sensation, or such
symptoms as would indicate a prolapse (falling down) of
the vaginal walls from weakness or relaxation of the columns
and muscular tissue which give them support, then
the Femina antiseptic uterine lotion should be used, as
before described, with this difference, that double the quantity
should be dissolved in the cupful of hot water, and then
added to the half gallon of warm water of the same temperature
and used in the same manner. When the Femina
antiseptic uterine lotion is used in its double strength, the
remedy loses nothing in its healing effect but becomes more
astringent, strengthening, and disinfectant.</p>

<p>Be sure that the nozzle of the syringe sweeps the entire
vaginal cavity, and if the above quantity of fluid should
not be sufficient to thoroughly cleanse the vagina, then use
double the quantity of fluid.</p>

<p>With this prescription I have cured cases of leucorrhœa
of twenty years’ standing which had gone through the ordeal
of all the different treatments that they were capable of undergoing.</p>

<p>I would recommend to those patients who feel their
wombs dragged down, the <i>knee-chest posture</i>, that means, to
kneel down on the floor with the hips elevated as high as
possible and the chest close down to the floor. This position
rolls the abdominal organs upwards and forwards, and thus
naturally draws the womb and vagina into their normal
positions, much better than any mechanical appliance or
operator can possibly accomplish it. It simply allows the
relaxed organs, through the natural law of gravitation, to
gravitate where they belong. It is necessary to retain this
kneeling position for only ten or fifteen minutes, repeated
twice a day, say night and morning, and the curative effect
is truly wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>When I speak of the curative measures of displacements
in general and of falling of the womb downwards and backwards
in particular, I will give a detailed description of the
knee-chest position.</p>

<p>There should be a choice in selecting a vaginal syringe
or a syringe for vaginal bathing. The “fountain syringe”
has several objections that are insurmountable. In the first
place, the quantity of fluid that is to be used is limited by
the capacity of the reservoir, or in order to replenish it, the
even tenor of the rinsing is disturbed. Another objection
is, that the convenient peg upon which to hang it is not
always present, or a shelf upon which to rest it not high
enough; then there is not the control over the stream that
is desirable, so that considerable confusion arises at times
from the fluid wetting things that had better be kept dry.
For these reasons I prefer a bulb syringe.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">HYGIENIC MEASURES FOR CATARRHAL DISEASES
OF THE FEMALE ORGANS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> treatment for catarrhal inflammations in general and
of the pelvic organs in particular is certain and complete
without special attention being given to certain laws or rules
that are laid down for the preservation and attainment of
health, and these comprise one of the collateral departments
of medical science which is termed <i>hygiene</i>.</p>

<p>What the skin or integument is to the exterior of the
body, the mucous membrane which lines the respiratory
passages and other organs is to the interior of the body.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane is only a modification of the
skin, and while it differs in its glandular composition in the
different organs that it lines, in the main, it retains the common
characteristics of the skin or outer covering of the
body.</p>

<p>The <i>corium</i> or fibrous layer of the mucous membrane is
analogous to the <i>derma</i> of the skin; and it is in fact a continuation
of it at the orifices of the body.</p>

<p>The corium of the mucous membrane supports an epithelial
layer of cells that are of various forms, differing in
the different organs that it lines.</p>

<p>Underneath the corium of the mucous membrane there
is the fibrovascular layer, which contains the blood vessels,
lymphatics and nerves and embedded in the epithelial cells
supported by the corium are the numerous mucous glands
or follicles. In some portions of the mucous tract and projecting
out of it are little elevations called villi or papillæ,
analogous to the papillæ of the skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>These glands and papillæ exist only at certain parts and
are modified according to the function that the organ performs.
The mucous glands of the stomach differ from those
of the intestines, and those of the mouth from those of the
bronchial tubes. The mucous membrane of the womb differs
from all the rest, by having no submucous or fibrovascular
layer; the mucous glands of the womb are imbedded
and extend directly into the muscular tissue of the
organ. The secreting glands, which form a special feature of
mucous membranes, are abundantly supplied by small capillary
blood vessels and nerves, so that any disturbance of the
general or systemic circulation or a derangement of the
nervous system will at once greatly influence the healthy or
normal secretion of the membrane, just exactly as the skin
is affected by cold or fright.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate all the causes that operate for
either good or evil, we must pause for a moment and consider
the sympathy with and the close relation of the mucous
membrane to the circulation of the blood and the nervous system.
The mucous membrane of the different organs is often
made the safety valve through which obnoxious materials
or morbid conditions of the blood are eliminated from the
system, and for that reason I have long ago discarded the
usual harsh measures in the treatment of sudden or acute
catarrhs. I have found that, by carefully watching and
giving close attention to the details of certain rules of health,
catarrhs speedily disappear of their own accord: on the
other hand, if irritating local remedies are constantly used,
catarrhs continue to grow worse.</p>

<p>This demonstrated fact so very often repeated, impressed
upon my mind the importance of hygienic measures for the
successful treatment of catarrhal inflammations, whether
they are of the respiratory organs or of the female pelvic organs.
The most prominent and efficacious measures are to
be found in intelligent precautions for preventing colds and
inuring the system to changes of temperature by appropriate
outdoor exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>By far the greater proportion of female complaints are
catarrhal inflammations, and these fasten themselves upon
all the pelvic organs&mdash;on the bladder, vagina, womb and
Fallopian tubes.</p>

<p>We generally know how we contract a bronchial catarrh
or bronchitis, a nasal catarrh or sore throat; in precisely the
same manner do women contract most of their pelvic catarrhs,
that is, from a common cold or sudden chilling of
the body or part of the body.</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas F. Rumbold, in his work on the “Hygiene
and Treatment of Catarrh,” says: “The history of every case
of chronic catarrh attests that the complaint commenced
with colds in the head and that the disease grew upon the
patient almost imperceptibly, the first colds being so trivial
in character as to attract but little attention.”</p>

<p>This statement is as true of the great majority of cases of
vaginal and uterine catarrh as it is of catarrhs of the air
passages, and for this reason the measures and precautions
for the prevention of colds must be one of the features in the
successful treatment of female complaints.</p>

<p>The particulars of the causation of colds and the hygienic
precautions for their prevention are hardly ever given
the attention which their importance demands in the treatment
for catarrhal complaints of women, so that a great
deal of suffering is left unrelieved and a great deal of expensive
and useless doctoring is endured. Altogether too
much reliance is placed upon a wash or some local application
made by the doctor to the affected parts, and, indeed,
the mainspring of the catarrhal affection is entirely overlooked
or neglected, which is, the susceptibility to the recurrence
of fresh colds.</p>

<p>The injurious effects of taking cold or chilling the body
or any part of it, have been the subject of special inquiry in
Germany. The mucous membrane and the skin seem the
most sensitive to sudden changes from a warm to a colder
atmosphere, but observations have already proven that besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the usual catarrhal inflammations, there are other inflammatory
conditions that are developed. The kidneys,
lungs, and liver have been found to be the seat of inflammations
in a series of experiments that were made with rabbits
that were removed from a warm to a much colder
apartment, and from this may be inferred that these conditions
originate similarly in the human subject.</p>

<p>The logical conclusions of these researches have been,
that the chilled or cooled blood becomes chemically altered
and acts as a direct irritant in the small capillary vessels,
and by that means all the phenomena of inflammation of
the tissues are excited, and these of course develop wherever
the cold may strike or locate.</p>

<p>When we speak of a slight or a bad cold, we cannot
form the least idea of the remote effects that the cold may
bring about. It may lay the foundation of a nephritis or
Bright’s disease of the kidneys, or some other lesion, and
that it often gives rise to vaginal and uterine catarrh is as
certain as that it gives rise to nasal catarrh or a cold in the
head.</p>

<p>An aptitude to take cold grows with each repetition of
the attack and the prolonged duration of the acute catarrhal
symptoms. And for that reason persons grow into the habit
of taking cold upon the slightest exposure or change of
temperature. At this stage of catarrh there is an abnormal
sensitiveness of the mucous membrane and skin, in which
the slightest draught of air or even passing from one room
to another occasions an attack of sneezing or a chill and
other symptoms that will indispose the patient for several
days.</p>

<p>The great majority of individuals have a natural predisposition
to certain diseases.</p>

<p>In anatomy the body has been divided into systems. A
system is an assemblage of organs composed of the same
tissues and intended for similar functions, as the circulatory
system, the nervous system, the muscular system, the cutaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
system, etc.; these systems are all liable to particular
diseases. In one person the mucous membrane of the respiratory
system is the most sensitive part of the body, while
in another, and especially in women, it is the mucous membrane
of the genito-urinary system. In other words, one
person will take a cold and it will settle in the head or on
the bronchial tubes, while another from the same exposure
will get a catarrhal inflammation of the bladder or womb;
this is only explained on the theory of natural predispositions,
and, perhaps, hereditary taints.</p>

<p>If a person once knows the weak or vulnerable points,
he can outgrow them, by employing such rules of hygiene
as experience has taught to be useful. There is much more
benefit to be derived in an educational treatment directed
to the prevention of disease, for this is also in the nature of
a cure, than in a blind obedient faith in the treatment or
remedy of a physician who may be ignorant, and generally
is, of the laws of health or the science of hygiene.</p>

<p>To promote health and to antagonize disease is greatly
within one’s own power, because there is no doubt that most
diseases are the result of imprudence that cannot be attributed
to ignorance, because persons commit these errors with
a full knowledge of their evil effects.</p>

<p>A healthy habitation, that has all the advantages of pure
air and sunshine, is an essential feature in regaining health
and encouraging a cure. There are hundreds of persons
who have been sick and miserable for years, and who have
made the rounds of all the doctors they ever heard of, without
the least benefit to themselves, because they were never
told how to live, and their living rooms are dark and sunless
and poorly ventilated.</p>

<p>The even and equable temperature of all the rooms of a
house should be kept in constant view, so that sudden and
extreme changes of temperature are avoided.</p>

<p>Warming a dwelling artificially should be one of the
important features in the construction of a completely-furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
residence. This subject has been neglected, owing
to the temperate climate of California, yet the moisture of
the air, and the closeness with which dwellings are built in
cities, exclude the rays of the sun and make houses too cold
for health and comfort. In our climate we become more
sensitive to the cold air than those who live in drier regions.</p>

<p>In shaded houses and rooms, especially in damp weather,
we need artificial heating as much as they do in colder climates,
so that architects should make it a study to introduce
a system of heating that will insure an equable temperature
throughout the entire building, at a minimum of expense.</p>

<p>The fireplace or open hearth, which has become so popular
with us as the pleasantest and healthiest mode of heating
and also insuring ventilation, should be discarded for
something much better. The fact that the fire is directly
beneath the chimney flue explains the fact that eighty-seven
per cent of the total heat yielded by coal or coke and
ninety-four per cent of that yielded by wood escapes through
the chimney. This enormous loss of temperature arises from
the current of air necessary for combustion, carrying with it
a large quantity of the heat produced which is lost in the
atmosphere. This of course is a means of <i>ventilation</i>, but a
little reflection will convince almost anyone that it cannot
be the most practical, and in this State where coal is very
high it is equally expensive. The smoke, soot, and ashes
that are inseparable from the open fireplace make it troublesome
and dirty, not to say anything of the coal gas, which
poisons the atmosphere of a room, and I have often noticed
its noxious influence on infants.</p>

<p>There are objections against warming one or two rooms
of a house and leaving the others cold. A warm sitting
room, while the halls and bedrooms remain cold and chilly,
is a very fruitful source of cold and catarrhs.</p>

<p>There is a vast difference between heating for health, and
heating to have warm rooms; in the former, the warm rooms
would be incidental to health and comfort, while in the latter
you might sacrifice health for warm rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Heating by hot air has serious objections that may be
briefly stated as follows: Fresh air passing through or around
red hot furnaces, becomes so rarefied that it no longer contains
sufficient oxygen for healthful breathing purposes.</p>

<p>The expansion and contraction of the furnace allows the
escape of the noxious gases of combustion which become
unavoidably mixed with the hot air that is to heat the
dwelling, and thus vitiate the air that is to be breathed, and
should there be any malaria from defective sewerage in the
basement that, too, would be circulated with the heated air.</p>

<p>It seems also to be impossible to distribute hot air equally
to all the rooms of a house through long flues, for the hot air
is choked off at the registers by the counter currents of cold
air from the rooms on the side of the house exposed to the
winds, while the protected side is always overheated.</p>

<p>I have practically demonstrated, in my own residence,
that hot water is the most simple and efficient means of heating
a dwelling for both health and comfort, and for several
reasons: There is no danger of overheating, and there is no
possibility of vitiating the air, because the temperature of
the hot water is always lower than even the boiling point.</p>

<p>With a proper distribution of the heated water through
pipes, and radiators of sufficient heating surface, all rooms
can be warmed to an equal temperature. Another consideration
is the economy in fuel when properly constructed heaters
are used, for the water readily absorbs the heat and retains
it for hours after the fire has ceased to burn. Unlike
steam heating, a moderate fire will warm the house in moderate
weather. Hot water heating does not exclude a practical
scientific system of ventilation. There is no danger
from explosion, nor from fire, the plant is absolutely odorless
and noiseless, and requires neither mechanical skill nor
close attention to run it. There is no doubt of the durability
of a hot water system, for if properly constructed it
should last as long as the building, and the cost is less than
a number of mantels with the necessary flues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>The most comfortable average temperature for living
rooms is from 65 to 70 degrees Fahr., for hospitals and sick
rooms a higher temperature is generally required, say from
75 to 80 degrees Fahr.</p>

<p>Dr. Horace Dobell, of London, in his work entitled
“Winter Cough,” makes some very practical and useful remarks,
when he says: “But before leaving the subject of sudden
changes of temperature, I must not forget to speak of
sleeping rooms. It is quite astonishing what follies are
committed with regard to the temperature of sleeping rooms.
On what possible ground people justify the sudden transition
from the hot sitting room to a wretched cold bedroom,
which may not have had a fire in it for weeks or months, it
is impossible to say, but it is quite certain that the absurd
neglect of properly warming bedrooms, is a fruitful source
of all forms of catarrh. We cannot too much impress this
upon our patients.”</p>

<p>There is another source of danger in artificial heating,
and that is, in having the air of the house always much
warmer than the most favored temperature of the open air.
This is a great mistake because it is under these circumstances
almost impossible to go from an overheated house
or apartment into the open fresh air without catching cold,
and for this reason the thermometer should be found in
every well-regulated household. Women who are under
treatment for female disease should never get into a cold
bed, even if there has been fire in the sleeping room during
the day. In damp and cold weather there should be greater
precaution in this respect. The best bed warmer is one or
more earthenware jugs, like the German seltzer water jugs,
filled with hot water. Earthenware radiates the heat better
and retains the warmth longer than glass, while there is no
danger of the heat cracking the jug, as it will glass bottles.
One or two of these jugs filled with hot water and put into a
bed an hour or so before retiring will bring the temperature
up to an agreeable warmth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Proper clothing is perhaps from a sanitary standpoint of
equal importance with that of artificial heating and ventilation.
With appropriate clothing, the body can be protected
against the inclemency of the weather and the sudden
changes of the atmosphere so that no ill effects are
experienced from the great changes of temperature to which
we are exposed. Women are dressed less warmly than
men, although they do not possess the bodily strength to resist
cold in the same degree as men. Their garments are
not only made of lighter material, but the loose, fluttering
manner in which they hang around the limbs does not protect
their bodies in the same thorough manner that similar
material made after the style of men’s clothing protects men.</p>

<p>This does not imply that women should don men’s clothing,
because the present costume or outside apparel of
women of civilized countries, is both graceful and modest.
A reform, however, in her <i>underclothing</i> is not only desirable
but in many cases absolutely necessary to insure permanent
relief from catarrhal affections.</p>

<p>All women who are suffering from uterine or pelvic
diseases, and who are still wedded to the injurious costume
of open drawers and skirts, have an important lesson to learn.</p>

<p>A warm and complete covering for the lower extremities
and pelvic organs is paramount to any medicine or treatment
that can be given.</p>

<p>It is during the menstrual period that the pelvic organs
are more susceptible to congestion and inflammation from
exposures than at any other time, and from the manner in
which women dress, it is surprising that there is not more
sickness among them than there really is. Wide and open
cotton drawers, and skirts hanging loosely around their limbs,
with cotton hose, are no protection against drafts and sudden
changes, so that it often happens that the extremities are
chilled and cold, which is in itself sufficient to cause uterine
diseases. When this exposure continues, with some already
existing disease, it will neutralize the best-directed efforts to
accomplish a cure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said of the celebrated Boerhave, that among his
effects there was a carefully-sealed prescription, which contained
the secret for preserving health and vigor to a ripe old
age. In his last will and testament it was provided that the
prescription should be sold to the highest bidder at public
auction. A physician who was anxious to procure the recipe
of this renowned Dutch doctor, bought it for a very high price.
On breaking the seal and anxiously unfolding the paper,
he found these words: “Keep the head cool, the extremities
warm, and the abdomen free.” The buyer was greatly chagrined
at the simplicity of the supposed panacea, but, if the
profession and the public only appreciated the real worth of
the advice, there would be much less sickness.</p>

<p>This strikes at most of the evils in dress that pave the
way for diseases of women. It comprises the evil effects of
tight lacing and compressing the abdominal organs by
improper support for the skirts. A corset should never be
worn so tight that the hand cannot be passed through the
waist line. In the absence of a waist or shoulder straps for
the support of the skirts from the shoulders, shoulder straps
should be fastened directly to the corset, so as to relieve the
hips and abdomen from the weight of the clothing.</p>

<p>The corset waist is not only a perfect substitute for a
corset, in supporting the bosom and preserving the form so
as to give a handsome figure, but it supports the skirts without
restricting the circulation and respiration, or compressing
the abdominal organs. In buying or making a waist or
bodice, particular attention must be paid to the shoulder
bands, so that these bands are short enough to give the waist
or bodice support from the shoulders. If, then, the skirts
are buttoned to the waist, the weight is taken from the hips,
where it injuriously depresses the abdominal organs, and
falls on the shoulders, where it cannot do any harm. There
is a good deal of humbuggery about these new devices, and
those who make it a business to sell them, never take the
pains, or are incompetent, to properly fit the waist. If one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
only bears in mind that, if the waist does not support the
skirts from the shoulders, there is nothing gained over wearing
an old-style corset, imposition is impossible.</p>

<p>The dressing for the feet should be warm and comfortable.
Women who go to balls and parties should always
wear overshoes in going to and coming from an entertainment.
Thin and light shoes must be avoided in cold
and damp weather; in fact, there is nothing that women
should be more careful about than too light and low shoes
which do not keep the feet warm. For comfort and keeping
the feet warm, there is nothing like a loosely-fitting
leather shoe, with wide and thick soles, and a low, flat, English
heel. It is also the best “corn remedy” I know of.</p>

<p>When the weather is wet and cold, rubber overshoes
should be worn, and these should be removed when entering
the house. Women who have a tendency to cold
feet, will find the cork or felt soles worn inside of the shoes,
a great source of warmth and comfort. The coldest stratum
of air is invariably on the floor of the room, and there is,
perhaps, no easier or more unsuspected way to take a cold
than to exchange a pair of high, warm shoes that fit closely
around the ankles, for a pair of light, low slippers. If you
desire to rest your feet in a pair of light slippers, then add
a pair of heavy woolen socks over the stockings, this will
greatly lessen the chances of taking cold.</p>

<p>Women who are suffering from pelvic or womb diseases,
and who are anxious to get well, and those who are troubled
with painful menstruation, and menstrual irregularities,
should wear woolen hose. Thin cotton, silk-mixed, or silk
hose are not sufficiently warm, nor do they retain the natural
heat of the body like woolen stockings.</p>

<p>Those who have once accustomed themselves to woolen
hose, should not discard them in the summer months for
cotton, linen or silk goods, and this is to be particularly observed
on this coast, but the hose should be exchanged for
thinner and lighter goods of the same material, corresponding
to the demands of the season. It would not be wise or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
prudent to wear the same quality and amount of clothing in
warm weather as in cold; otherwise the excessive clothing
in the summer months will induce perspiration on the
slightest exertion, and thus the system becomes most susceptible
to cold when the weather changes or becomes cooler.</p>

<p>Elastic garters to maintain the tops of the stockings in
position should be avoided. Rubber bands make a continuous
compression on the vessels and nerves, although almost
every woman claims that she does not wear her garters
tight, yet at night when she removes the elastics there
are deep furrows marking the constriction of the garters.
The spring-wire garters are just as injurious, for they also
exert a continuous pressure.</p>

<p>The veins of the legs are, for the most part, superficial,
and this steady and gradual compression is very injurious
to the venous circulation, so that the blood is prevented
from returning from the limbs as readily as it should; this
induces cold feet, and when the circulation is already weak,
it often imparts a feeling of heaviness to the limbs, for
which women doctor but without getting any relief. The
only proper support for the hose is elastic straps that are
supported from the waist; they are now so well known and
for sale in every dry goods store that a description of them is
unnecessary.</p>

<p>To keep the legs and body warm is not a question of
quality or quantity of skirts or wraps. If the limbs under
them are not separately enveloped and are only covered with
thin cotton or silk hose and open cotton drawers, women are
continuously exposed to the cold, damp emanations from the
ground and to the drafts caused by the motion of the skirts,
and blasts of wind.</p>

<p>The most intelligent suggestions for Dress Reform are
those that are directed towards reducing the weight or displacing
the heavy, stiff, and unwieldy skirts and clothing
the extremities of the female in divided garments, so that
they are no longer exposed to the dangers of cold and drafts.
The divided skirt is in the direct line of a modest and desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
improvement of woman’s dress, and it is growing in
popularity among the most intelligent of reading and thinking
women. If the specialists of female diseases were to study
the interests of their patients with the same ardor that they
study the methods how best to fill their offices with patients,
on whom they perform useless and dangerous operations,
they would be of some actual benefit to our wives, mothers,
and sisters, and our women could be dressed as gracefully
as at present with less than half the underclothes to pack
around with them.</p>

<p>I am decidedly opposed to anything approaching in style
or shape the bloomer costume; the present style of outside
dress cannot possibly be improved for a comely garment,
but it is underneath this that an entire change should be
speedily effected. The divided skirt is cut like drawers that
have a width of thirty to forty inches of goods in each leg.
I believe that the width of each leg should not be more
than twenty-five to thirty inches; this makes the skirt
warmer and lighter. This is not attached to a band to
fasten around the waist, but to a yoke, which should be buttoned
to the bodice waist, suspending the skirt from the
shoulders. The material will be a matter of individual
taste; the two qualities that should be always looked for are
softness and warmth, and for that reason Jersey flannel and
ladies’ cloth are the most suitable material; in summer or
warm climates, pongee or wash silks may be substituted.</p>

<p>The skirt is cut on the bias to fit the hips, where it is
fulled in and attached to a yoke instead of a band and in
the back it laps about two or three inches. The advantage
of the divided skirt is that it protects the limbs and body
against drafts and cold emanations, and takes the place of
<i>all underskirts and petticoats</i>. This skirt alone, however,
would be insufficient to accomplish all that is desired by
way of guarding against exposures; for this reason there is
also a so-called <i>Union suit</i> worn under the divided skirt to
complete the covering of the limbs.</p>

<p>Union suits, as the name implies, unite a pair of closely-fitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
drawers with an undershirt. There is no particular
advantage in uniting the underdrawers with the undershirt,
but there is certainly no disadvantage. The principal object
that is to be attained is not in unionizing drawers and
shirts, but wearing such <i>closely fitting undergarments</i> that the
<i>extremities</i> are permanently protected, and in having them
so lapped or closed that the <i>abdomen and pelvic organs</i> are
securely protected against cold.</p>

<p>Equestrian tights are made on the same principle and
for a similar purpose as union suits, namely, to properly
and surely cover the limbs and in a measure displace the
great load of petticoats that women usually wear. They
come in drawers and also in combination suits with the undershirts;
a choice may be left to individual taste. There
are different <i>brands</i> of these goods on sale in all the dry
goods stores of our large cities, the prices being regulated by
material and quality of the goods from which they are
made. The woolen goods are preferable for practical
purposes.</p>

<p>Women who do not like the woven closely-fitting drawers
can take their choice between the latter and home-made
flannel drawers, the French flannel for the lighter and the
English bully for heavier and warmer clothing will be
found to be the most serviceable materials; patterns for
making up closed or button drawers may be had at the
leading pattern stores of any city.</p>

<p>Women who cannot grow up to an appreciation of the
divided skirt should by all means wear equestrian tights or
buttoned flannel drawers, under cotton or linen ones; this
will enable them to throw off one or two petticoats or skirts
because the drawers will safely substitute the skirts and be
much lighter. Some women dread the absence of skirts on
account of appearing too scant; a little extra fullness and
drapery to the dress make the absence of skirts not noticeable.
If this were not quite so, there appears no satisfactory
reason why a woman should feel embarrassed to modestly
display the contour of her form any less than a man.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">METRITIS OR INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is an inflammation of the entire substance of the
womb, which, like all inflammatory processes, is <i>acute</i> or
<i>chronic</i>.</p>

<p>Inflammation does not always affect the whole body of
the womb, but it is quite oftener limited to one or the other
layer or membrane that enters into its architectural whole.
Then, again, there is the anatomical division of the organ
into a body or <i>corpus</i>, and a neck or cervix; of these either
one may be affected, without the other, so that inflammation
of the cervix should be the subject of a separate inquiry.</p>

<p>Most of the diseases of the womb are due to inflammation.
This was the opinion of J. H. Bennett, of London, as
long ago as 1845, in which year the first edition of his work
on “Inflammation of the Uterus” was published. Up to
that time, the subject had never been practically pursued to
the same logical conclusions, so that the opinions of the
leading professional minds were far from unanimous on
this question. But the vigor and energy with which the
young author defended his views, forced attention and conviction
upon the greater part of the profession, in this country
and Europe.</p>

<p>He started out with a view to prove: “1. That inflammation
is the <i>primum mobile</i> in uterine affections, and that
from it follow, as results, displacements, ulcerations and affections
of the appendages. 2. That menstrual troubles and
leucorrhœa are merely symptoms of this morbid state. 3.
That in the vast majority of cases, inflammatory action will
be found to confine itself to the cervical canal and not to
affect the cavity of the body.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the appearance of the first edition of Dr. Bennett’s
work, which is now forty-six years ago, there have been
many careful and clever observers in this field of pathology,
but there is yet to appear a successful contradiction of the
truth of his inflammatory doctrine. Twenty-six years after
Dr. Bennett wrote the above book, he read a paper before
the British Medical Association on the same subject, in
which there is no modification of his first conclusions on
the importance of inflammatory lesions. He says: “1. Uterine
displacements are by many too much studied <i>per se</i> (by
themselves) independently of the inflammatory diseases that
complicate and often occasion them. 2. That the examinations
made to ascertain the existence of inflammatory complications
are often not made with sufficient care and minuteness,
as evidenced by the fact that I constantly see in
practice cases in which inflammatory processes have been
entirely neglected, and the secondary displacements alone
treated. 3. That inflammatory lesions are often the principal
cause of the uterine displacements through the enlargement
and increased weight of the womb, or a portion of its
tissues, which they occasion. 4. That when such inflammatory
conditions exist, as a rule they should be treated
and cured and then time given to nature to absorb morbid
enlargements before mechanical and surgical measures are
resorted to.”</p>

<p>If these propositions could be engrossed and a copy sent
to every doctor in the land, as a safe and sure guide in his
treatment of diseases of women, it would prove a great boon
to the suffering women of this country. One of the notorious
abuses of the profession, is the penchant for the employment
of mechanical means, either by means of instruments
or the surgeon’s knife. Women are wantonly subjected to
painful and tedious treatments which in many cases only
aggravate their original suffering, while a few simple rules
of hygienic treatment would not only restore them to health
and vigor, but would save them the privation of paying fees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to incompetent, unscrupulous or avaricious doctors, who
have only one ambition, that is, to get the patient’s money.
I have known an instance where this barbarous course under
the guise of scientific treatment, broke up the home of a once
happy and prosperous couple, and finally when the resources
were so low that the expense incident to housekeeping and a
nurse could no longer be defrayed, the household effects
were disposed of, and, as a last resort, the overdoctored
woman was taken to a hospital, where her last hopes were
lulled into an artificial sleep, while the surgeons performed
an operation from which her depleted body and squandered
vitality could never recover. She died.</p>

<p>I am convinced from observations in large female clinics
in Berlin, and from my own studies in the pathological
laboratory while a student abroad, that Dr. Bennett’s conclusions
are corroborated by actual facts. The freedom with
which dangerous operations are undertaken for comparatively
trivial complaints is degenerating into a license that
is criminal and which in some cases is nothing less than
murder. In the absence of a high moral sentiment which
should control the profession, but does not, the State must step
in and say who shall practice medicine and surgery, and by
limiting competition, the evil propensity to make the most
of one’s opportunities will not be elevated into a fine art, and
men, although unscrupulous, may be at least indifferent
honest.</p>

<p>Acute metritis comes on suddenly, and this occurs quite
often during the menstrual period. Women as a rule are
altogether too careless during menstruation; they seem to
forget that at this time the womb is congested and swollen,
and that if the natural flow of the blood is interfered with,
this congestion will turn into an inflammation. Exposure
to cold, or getting the feet damp, or inordinate exercise
that overheats the system, will bring this about. Sometimes
there may be a tumor or swelling in the womb which
occludes the cervical canal, so that the menstrual fluid cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
escape; this will also cause inflammation. A stricture
of the cervical canal, occasioned by the womb being flexed,
will interfere with the egress of the menstrual flow, and this
also may give rise to inflammation. Vaginal injections
either too hot or too cold, and particularly immediately
after copulation, when the pelvic organs are still in a high
state of congestion, is quite liable to excite metritis. Gonorrhœal
infection is another source of inflammation, but this
is invariably preceded by an <i>endometritis</i>, which I will consider
separately.</p>

<p>Large, ill-fitting pessaries worn in the vagina for a supposed
retroflected or prolapsed uterus, or a stem pessary, are
fruitful causes of metritis.</p>

<p>Other causes are criminal abortion, complicated with
blood poisoning from the unclean probes or instruments, that
the abortionist has employed on previous operations without
thoroughly cleansing and disinfecting them; the application
of strong caustics to the cervix of the womb, as well
as injections into the cavity of the uterus. Meddlesome doctoring
by means of the unskillful and unnecessary use of instruments,
like the probing of the womb without proper antiseptic
precautions, or the scraping, stretching or operating
on the womb without the essential antiseptic precautions
which a scientific comprehension of the subject demands,
has frequently caused this affection.</p>

<p>It occurs very often as a part of the general inflammation
produced by the absorption of putrid or septic matter
during the childbed period. This indicates a lack of cleanliness
on the part of the attendants during confinement; inflammations
of this nature constitute one of the types of
<i>puerperal</i> or childbed fever.</p>

<p>The most prominent symptom is pain. This is greatly
aggravated on the slightest pressure, or on moving or turning
in bed. Upon a digital examination, the womb is found
enlarged or swollen, and when the organ is tilted up on the
examiner’s finger, there is a sharp lancinating pain radiating
from it in all directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The first symptoms of pain are always accompanied with
fever, and this may have been ushered in or alternated with
a chill. The pain may be first felt rather deeply in the pelvis,
and this is increased by a frequent desire to pass urine
and a straining of the rectum. It may further become complicated
with a looseness of the bowels, or an obstinate constipation.
Nausea and vomiting is a frequent symptom during
the course of the disease, and if the metritis is developed
during menstruation, the flow may suddenly stop, but, on
the other hand, the hemorrhage may become alarmingly
profuse. Standing, walking, coughing and straining at
stool excite the most excruciating pain, so that a recumbent
quiet position is the only comfortable way for the patient to
maintain herself, with the head as low as possible to insure
the most easy recumbency.</p>

<p>The treatment for acute metritis depends somewhat on
the cause in each individual case. There are, however, two
indications that require to be met, and these are common to
all inflammations, namely, to relieve the pain and check the
inflammatory process.</p>

<p>The former is quickly relieved by introducing into the
vagina a Femina vaginal capsule in the usual manner;
repeating every six to eight hours, until the pain is sufficiently
alleviated to occasion no suffering; then one capsule
should be employed every night until cured or until restlessness
requires that something must be done to calm the
patient.</p>

<p>If the metritis is due to suppressed or checked menstruation
from cold or exposure, then, and only then, are hot
fomentations over the entire abdomen the most appropriate
application, and if the patient is plethoric, I advise a half-dozen
leeches to the inguinal region of one or both sides to
be of unequaled value for checking the disease.</p>

<p>Until my experience and observation in German hospitals,
I was in the habit of employing hot applications for
all acute inflammations of the abdominal organs. These
were either in the form of hot-water fomentations or flaxseed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
poultices. Hot applications undoubtedly give relief,
but I doubt whether they ever cut short or abridge the inflammatory
process in any case. I am inclined to believe
that in a great many instances hot fomentations have the
tendency to encourage suppuration, and that an abscess is
often the result of their use. I have seen decidedly better
results from <i>cold applications</i>, and the colder the better, so
that I now employ them universally in all acute inflammations
of the pelvic organs except in the noted exception in
which the inflammation is due to a sudden check of the
menses from exposure. As a preventive of inflammations,
after delicate operations on the uterus, I apply the <i>rubber</i> ice
bag with invariable success.</p>

<p>The most suitable rubber bag for this purpose is a size
of six by twelve inches; it should be filled with broken pieces,
and then securely tied. I prefer to envelop the bag in a
thin layer of flannel, so as to take off the cold, clammy sensation
which the rubber imparts to the skin. There should
be two of these bags, in case of accidentally tearing one, and
so that the reserved one may be in readiness when the other
is removed. The cold does not only check and control the
inflammation, but it also benumbs the nerves, so that it greatly
relieves pain. I keep these ice bags applied over the region
of the womb, until all the acute symptoms disappear. The
vagina, however, should be irrigated with medium hot borax
water, once a day, so as to remove any irritating discharge
from the uterine cavity.</p>

<p>The digestive derangements that so often accompany
acute metritis; the nausea and vomiting of this and kindred
diseases, are alleviated by this formula:&mdash;</p>

pieces of ice. Constipation of the bowels should be relieved
by taking a Femina laxative tablet every six hours until the
stools are freely moved; after that one should be taken every
night or perhaps every other night, so as to keep the system
regulated.</p>

<p>Some persons suffer from costiveness because they do not
drink enough water, and when taking medicines to correct
this disorder it is always well to drink a large tumblerful of
water at the same time, and especially at bedtime, three or
more hours after supper, and early in the morning is another
good time for drinking water and taking a laxative.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">CHRONIC METRITIS OR CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
OF THE WOMB.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> from neglected or improper treatment, the acute
inflammation is not checked, so as to restore the organ to its
normal condition, the inflammatory process assumes a
chronic character. As inflammation is an <i>abnormal vital
activity</i>, which results in the proliferation or building up of
fibrous tissue, it must be naturally inferred that if the inflammatory
process is active in an organ for a considerable
length of time, the tissues of this organ must grow or increase,
so as to augment its size and weight. This is indeed
so, hence the other names that have been given to this
disease to distinguish it from the acute or transient form, all
imply <i>tissue growth</i>, as hypergenesis of the connective tissue,
engorgement or inflammatory hypertrophy of the uterus.</p>

<p>The entire organ may be thus affected, or it may be limited
to either one or the other anatomical divisions of the
uterus, namely, the body or the neck.</p>

<p>Of all the different varieties of chronic inflammation
of the womb, that of the neck or cervix is the most frequently
met. This is due to the fact that in married women
and those who have born children the cervix of the womb
is exposed to mechanical injury from coition, friction against
the vaginal walls in walking and from lacerations during
delivery.</p>

<p>The body of the womb is further removed from all these
mechanical agencies to which the cervix is exposed, for the
body is within the abdomen of the female, and for that reason
it is less liable to be injuriously affected by influences
that cause inflammatory enlargement. But notwithstanding
all this, it is a common disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>A great many cases of womb complaint that do not
yield to ordinary treatment are really of this nature, but
owing to carelessness or incompetency are never recognized.
The symptoms of this disease, which are obstinate leucorrhœa,
falling of the womb or displacements, are mistaken and
treated for the disease itself. Women who suffer with this
complaint are extremely liable to go on for quite a while
feeling comparatively well and in hopes that they are recovering,
when some extra exertion or exposure to cold brings
on a relapse, which lights up an acute inflammatory process.
This passes into the old troublesome disease and this resumes
its chronic form. After a repetition of the general
routine treatment, the patient may again live under the delusion
that she is going to get well only to have her hopes
blasted by a sudden reappearance of the former painful
symptoms, that are alike discouraging to herself and a
puzzle to her friends.</p>

<p>The cause of inflammatory enlargement of the uterus is
usually connected with <i>parturition</i> or <i>abortion</i>.</p>

<p>There never can be either the one or the other without
more or less <i>vascular activity</i>, which is essential to the repair
of the womb and its restoration to its physiological or
healthy condition. All the uterine tissues are at this time
in a high state of irritability, and if there is a natural predisposition
to inflammatory diseases, then the slightest obstacle
to an uninterrupted recovery will kindle an inflammatory
action, that will fasten itself on the uterus. In the
very nature of things this results in a deposition of inflammatory
material, with a consequent increase of intermuscular
fibrous tissue which increases the size and weight of the
uterus.</p>

<p>What our mothers termed in former days “a bad getting
up,” that is, when women get up from their confinement
weakly and with more or less pain and dragging in
the pelvis on walking or the slightest exertion, is generally
owing to the above-described condition. This disease is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
now almost as common as ever. I can always trace these
cases to a confinement or an abortion.</p>

<p>It is very rare that it is due to a depreciation of vital
forces from improper food, over-exertion, a prolonged nervous
depression or a constitutional tendency to tubercle,
scrofula or some other hereditary diathesis, although these
undoubtedly predispose the patient to the disease.</p>

<p>Abortions stand at the head of all the causes that excite
this affection. When the uterus is pregnant and its natural
growth is abruptly checked by the destruction of the embryo,
then the organ becomes at once the seat of a congestion
and great vascular activity, for the purpose of repairing
the injury that the premature expulsion of the embryo or
fetus inflicted.</p>

<p>If this congestion is delayed from improper care or treatment
which fails to recognize the important fact that an
abortion or interruption of pregnancy is a much greater
shock to the system than a delivery at full term, it must
result in arrested <i>involution</i> or permanent inflammatory
enlargement. This most persons fail to appreciate, and, as
a result, they do not take the same precautions that they
would after the delivery of a living or fully-developed child.</p>

<p>I am well aware that criminal abortionists are in the
habit of deceiving their patrons by assuring them that there
is no danger or bad results to be feared from their criminal
operations. This is a vicious falsehood, and, coupled with the
statement that there is as yet no living being in the womb,
the crime of manslaughter is added to that of malpractice.
In every case of abortion, whether accidental or criminal,
the same care and attention must be given to the woman
as during any natural lying-in period.</p>

<p>There is a class of chronic inflammations that I have
noticed in women who have always suffered from painful
menstruations or from excessive or prolonged hemorrhage
at the regular monthly period. This is complicated with
some ovarian disease, which yields, however, to appropriate
treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>There is quite a series of symptoms that denote the existence
of chronic metritis; these are not all present in each
particular case but quite enough of them to diagnose the
disease. Some of these symptoms are in the nature of complications,
which in themselves may be mistaken for an individual
disease, but upon a careful inquiry they can be
traced directly to a chronic metritis, which if removed disposes
of all the lesser ailments.</p>

<p>The following are the most noted signs of this affection:
painful copulation, and pain on defecation; a dull, heavy,
dragging pain through the pelvis, much increased by walking;
during menstruation the mammæ are sensitive or
painful; several days before the approach of the menses
there is a dull pain, which lasts during the menstrual flow;
around the nipples, there is pigmentation or darkening;
sometimes nausea and vomiting, and dyspepsia, headache,
and languor; pressure on the rectum with tenesmus and
hemorrhoids; leucorrhœa from catarrh of the womb; pressure
on the bladder with tenesmus or straining.</p>

<p>This disease may continue for years uninterruptedly,
and, if there is not a cure accomplished, or successful measures
for its relief are not employed, it will continue until the
menopause, or change of life, which may effect a spontaneous
cure.</p>

<p>The enlargement is most noticeable in the cervix or neck.
This is sometimes so great as to extend one or two inches
into the vagina, and this condition is often mistaken for
falling of the womb or prolapse, which is far from a correct
diagnosis. A growing of the womb from chronic inflammation
is the proper explanation.</p>

<p>The hygienic suggestions given in a former chapter,
form an important auxiliary in the treatment of this complaint,
and for that reason it should be carefully studied.</p>

<p>The treatment of chronic metritis has been, up to within
a very recent period, anything but satisfactory in its results.
This was owing to an inadequate knowledge of the real
nature of the disease, which was marked by so many symptoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that were in themselves obscure and hard to separate
as such, from the main affection.</p>

<p>This confusion of the true nature of the pathological process,
resulted in a great many vague therapeutical resources,
so that the treatment is even yet far from uniform and thorough.
Many of the recognized resources laid down in the
text-books, on diseases of women, are not only useless, but
absolutely injurious, and, in order to save the reader time
and money, I will make a brief mention of the most prominent
of them.</p>

<p>Depletion, or the abstraction of blood in chronic metritis,
effects no permanent benefit in the inflammatory process. I
am convinced that, in the long run, the patients grow worse,
because this treatment lowers the vitality and reduces the
recuperative forces, which are so important, in the treatment
of all chronic complaints.</p>

<p>Scarifications or puncturing the cervix with a sharp
lance or pointed knife, will not sufficiently impress the
morbid process, so as to stimulate it into a healthy action.</p>

<p>Some authors speak very highly of cauterizations and
blisters upon the neck or lips of the womb; this I have repeatedly
tried, and in not a single instance was it of the
slightest use, but it aggravated the symptoms, and in one
case it excited a severe, acute metritis that proved almost fatal.</p>

<p>Specialists, as a rule, fall into routine practice, and exercise
neither originality or intelligence in practice, outside of
the text-book on their shelf. They inject strong fluids or
caustics into the cavity of the womb with a view of checking
the inflammation in that manner. This treatment is dangerous
and delusive. If the patient endures the treatment,
she may be stimulated for a time with the idea that something
very curative is being done, but my experience has
been that the disease only becomes worse, because the womb
is too delicate and sensitive an organ to improve under these
repeated irritating assaults.</p>

<p>There is a <i>home treatment</i> for mild cases which I recommend
to my patients, with satisfactory results. It consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
principally of dissolving one teaspoonful of the Femina
uterine lotion in a cupful of boiling hot water, after which
this should be added to a gallon of warm water of a temperature
of 105 degrees F.; these irrigations are to be taken
every night, and if the water can be borne hotter the temperature
may be gradually increased to 107 degrees F. A
napkin should be worn and the bed warmed with a hot water
bag before retiring. Ten to fifteen minutes later a
Femina vaginal capsule is to be introduced high up into the
vagina, by first quickly dipping the capsule into warm
water.</p>

<p>In obstinate cases I have used electricity with the greatest
success. This is administered by means of a broad dispersing
electrode applied on the abdomen, and another
electrode, covered with a sponge, is carried up the vagina, to
the womb. In this manner I employ an intensity of sixty
to one hundred and fifty milliampères, for ten to fifteen
minutes. This is repeated several times a week, and from
three to six weeks, and with other hygienic treatment the
patient recovers.</p>

<p>When women are in moderate circumstances, and can
spare neither time nor money to visit the office, for the
length of time that is required for the electrical treatment, I
follow the plan of the Berlin clinic, which originated in
Vienna, with Prof. Carl Braun, and is strongly recommended
and practiced by Dr. Martin, in Berlin. This consists
in an <i>amputation of the cervix</i>, or, in other words, the
abnormally elongated and enlarged uterus is trimmed down,
and the diseased membrane is scraped out. While the
cervix is recovering from the operation, there is also a diminution
in the size of the body of the organ, and the
chronic inflammation subsides with it. This operation is
not dangerous to life, and in my experience I have as yet
never had a bad symptom to interrupt the recovery. In obstinate
cases, it is, perhaps, one of the most useful surgical
measures that was ever devised, and we owe it to the genius
of Professor Braun, that all obstinate cases of this nature are
amenable to successful treatment.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">ENDOMETRITIS OR CATARRHAL INFLAMMATION
OF THE WOMB.</p>

<p><i>Endo</i> means within, and metritis signifies <i>womb</i> and <i>inflammation</i>,
and when all are combined, the compound term
denotes inflammation of the lining membrane of the womb,
which is the affection that I am now to consider.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to find a single person of middle
age who has not experienced sometime during life the discomforts
of a catarrh or cold of some part of the respiratory
passages, whether in the head or bronchial tubes.</p>

<p>The mucous membranes are especially sensitive to noxious
influences, and sound a timely note of warning by an
<i>acute catarrh</i>, which, if heeded, will in many instances save
the person from a dangerous, if not fatal sickness.</p>

<p>The adage, “Prevention is better than cure,” is one of
the most truthful sayings in the English language, and, if
persons would profit from the admonitions of a “<i>slight cold</i>,”
many a fatal pneumonia or bronchitis could be averted.</p>

<p>What is true of the mucous membrane that is common
to both sexes is true of that which is peculiar to the female
organs alone.</p>

<p>There is no mucous membrane that is more liable to
catarrhal inflammations than that lining the uterus.
There never was a woman who was not some time in her
life afflicted with a transient uterine catarrh. It may have
been of so mild a form that the symptoms which it occasioned
were hardly noticed, or, perhaps, ascribed to some
other ailment.</p>

<p>There are several varieties of endometritis; some of these
are based upon the length of time that the affection has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
lasted, while others owe their classification to the anatomical
division of the uterus into body and cervix. Those that relate
to the duration of the disease are either acute or chronic.</p>

<p>Acute endometritis is the most common form; it has also
been described under the names of acute uterine leucorrhœa,
acute uterine catarrh, and acute internal metritis. It
usually runs a rapid course, ending in recovery or in the
chronic form. It undoubtedly passes unrecognized in many
instances, and in this way many cases of painful menstruation
or suppressed menstruation are explainable.</p>

<p>It can be said that at each and every menstrual period
there is a <i>physiological catarrh</i>, which belongs to the natural
process of the menstrual function. During each menstruation
there is a hyperæmia, or congestion of the mucous
membrane, so that the turgent blood vessels rupture, and
this constitutes the menstrual flow. Before this congestion
reaches the point of bursting the capillaries, and about the
time that the sanguineous flow ceases, there is an increased
and altered mucous secretion of the mucous membrane. If
this secretion is prolonged beyond the normal period that
constitutes healthy menstruation, or if it continues to be
present at any time between the menstrual periods, it constitutes
a disease or a catarrh. Now when we consider the
close relation that the normal functions of the womb have
to those that are <i>abnormal</i>, and that the one may be the
stepping-stone to the other, we need not be surprised that
endometritis, or catarrh of the womb, is one of the most common
affections to which women are liable.</p>

<p>Chronic endometritis is where the disease has lasted for
a long time; some authorities consider it a rare affection,
but this is a great error. Any disease so frequent as acute
endometritis must, in the very nature of inflammatory processes,
become chronic, in a large proportion of cases.</p>

<p>Endometritis of the body of the womb, in contra-distinction
to a partial inflammation, located and confined to
the mucous membrane of the neck or cervix of the womb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
forms another or third variety of this affection. This disease
has been described under the names of chronic corporeal
endometritis, uterine catarrh, uterine leucorrhœa, and internal
metritis, and the seat of it is confined to the lining membrane
of the cavity of the womb, without complicating the
cavity of the cervix; but there is no doubt that when either
the one or the other is the seat of a stubborn catarrh, the
remaining portion of the uterus must become sooner or later
more or less compromised in the diseased process.</p>

<p>Chronic cervical endometritis is where the inflammation
affects the membrane of the neck; this has been described
under the names of cervical catarrh, cervical leucorrhœa, and
endocervicitis. These terms are all derived in composition
from the Latin word <i>cervix</i>, neck.</p>

<p>The uterus is really divided into two cavities that run
into each other; one of these is the cavity of the body, while
the other is the cavity of the cervix, a fusiform canal, measuring
about one inch and a quarter in length. The cervix
partly projects into the vagina, and, as a result, is liable to
injury and irritation, to which the other portion of the organ
is not exposed. Friction and other influences aggravate the
inflammatory process, so that erosions, granular and cystic
degenerations, follicular ulcers and chronic enlargements,
become complications of the catarrhal inflammation of the
cervix.</p>

<p>To return again to a consideration of the general aspect
of catarrh of the womb, for it is one and the same pathological
process that underlies the different forms. There is a
simplicity in the relation of cause and effect, that will strike
the casual student as one of the most instructive lessons
that it is possible to learn, because it also suggests the simplicity
of the measures of which persons can avail themselves
for the prevention or cure of this affection.</p>

<p>From the physiological reasons that were mentioned as
a cause of endometritis, it follows, as a natural consequence,
that the predisposition to catarrh of the womb, varies greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with the age of persons, so that before the age of puberty,
at a time when there are no periodical congestions of the
womb from the menses, it occurs very rarely, while from the
period of pubescence, and during the functional activity of
the pelvic organs, it is very prevalent, but at the approach
of the menopause and sexual decadence the predisposition
is again lost.</p>

<p>As far as the character and nature of uterine catarrh is
concerned, that which in technical language is termed the
<i>pathological anatomy</i> is no different from what it is in catarrhal
inflammations in other organs, so that the remarks that were
made on similar affections of other organs, apply with equal
correctness to catarrh of the uterus.</p>

<p>There is, however, one exception of which I desire to remind
the reader, and that is a hemorrhagic or granular
variety of inflammation. In this form of the disease the
mucous glands, and the blood vessels that are distributed
between these glandular tubules, increase or multiply enormously,
so that I have seen the mucous membrane in some
places a quarter of an inch in thickness. This is the most
obstinate variety to yield to ordinary remedies, and as it occasions
excessive and at times dangerous hemorrhage from
the womb, it should not be treated as conservatively as the
other varieties of which I have spoken.</p>

<p>There is only one sure method of cure that proved in my
hands a success, and that consists in the entire removal of
the diseased mucous surface.</p>

<p>Dr. Düvelius of Berlin made the discovery and demonstrated
the fact that the mucous glands of the uterus project
into the muscular tissue of the organ, and that if the
diseased mucous membrane is removed or scraped off, down
to the muscular layer, a healthy membrane is regenerated
from the terminal glandular ends that remain imbedded
in the muscular tissue. This seems to have been
proved by experience, for I have performed this operation
in several obstinate cases of uterine catarrh, and in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
instances the woman became subsequently pregnant, which
proves at least that the regenerated mucous membrane is
capable of performing its physiological function, as though
it never had been interfered with. With proper antiseptic
precautions and in skillful hands, there is absolutely no
danger in this operation, but the technique should be thoroughly
understood by the operator.</p>

<p>The etiology or causation of uterine catarrh resolves
itself into predisposing and exciting causes. Predispositions
are defined as that constitution or condition of the
body which disposes it to the action of disease under the
application of an exciting cause. Persons who possess a
thoroughly healthy constitution may be exposed to exciting
causes without the slightest danger of contracting diseases,
to which others who are predisposed fall victims. The predisposing
causes of endometritis are a naturally enfeebled
constitution; the existence of a scrofulous or tuberculous
habit; impoverishment of the blood from chlorosis; prolonged
mental depression; improper and insufficient food;
prolonged lactation; frequent parturition under unfavorable
surroundings; any indiscretion after delivery which interferes
with the regeneration of the womb; styles of dress that
depress the uterus; want of fresh air and wholesome exercise.</p>

<p>Professor T. G. Thomas, in his work on Diseases of
Women, asks the question why most of these influences
should produce this affection more than others. His answer
is that “they do not do so.” “Sometimes they cause chronic
pneumonia; at other times granular lids, and again at other
times chronic endometritis.”</p>

<p>The exciting causes laid down by the same eminent
authority are “displacement of the womb; excessive or intemperate
coition; the use of intra-uterine pessaries; puerperal
endometritis; exposure or fatigue after confinement;
efforts at production of abortion and prevention of conception;
vaginitis either simple or due to gonorrhœal infection;
painful obstructive menstruation; exposure during menstruation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
sudden checking of the menstrual flow; and
tumors in the uterine cavity or walls.” Some of the causes
here enumerated are much more fruitful of the disease than
others. A woman whose constitution has been weakened,
and whose digestion is deranged, by habits of indolence and
luxury, whose style of dress so depresses the abdominal
viscera that her uterus is pressed down into the vagina,
is particularly liable to develop a catarrhal inflammation
from connubial approaches. When these are not without
pain, then there is some predisposition that should be inquired
into and righted.</p>

<p>Uncleanliness is not spoken of by authorities as among
the causes of uterine catarrh, yet it is a very frequent one.
I have succeeded in curing so many catarrhal affections of
the vagina and uterus by simply advising the use of vaginal
irrigations with <i>borated</i> warm water, that I am convinced
that a lack of personal cleanliness is a very prolific cause of
this affection. The accessible generative organs, both of the
female and male, should be the object of thorough rinsings
so as to reduce the possibility of infection to the least degree.
All mucous membranes have their natural secretions, and
these are on light provocations abnormally increased. The
vagina is always the seat of more or less bacterial fermentation
or decomposition, and if this is retained for any length
of time, it becomes not only putrid and offensive, but also a
direct source of infection to the mucous membrane of the
womb. This is more so in a married woman, who is exposed
to the carelessness of her male consort, who has not
been apprised of the dangers of septic infection, that may be
innocently communicated to the wife by negligence of his
own person. The wife is exposed to all and every impurity
that the male has on his person, and thus she is in constant
danger of having her internal organs infected, from the outer
organs of the male.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that many women become infected
from this source, and that obscure and stubborn catarrhs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
vagina and womb are strictly traceable to personal uncleanliness
of the male. From the researches of Dr. Noeggerath
of New York, it would seem that in a great many cases of
pelvic diseases in women, the affections can be traced to a
<i>latent gonorrhœa</i> in the male. This phrase means a gonorrhœa
in the male apparently cured, which even two years
after the supposed cure infects a healthy vagina, causing a
discharge and a complication of the uterine mucous membrane.
I have seen some cases that fully corroborate the
views of Noeggerath, so that before we put the blame of
uterine disease solely on the shoulders of the wife, let us
find out how much the husband is to blame.</p>

<p>Specialists in particular, but doctors in general, often
forget that a woman has other organs besides a womb and
ovaries; there is a relation of cause and effect between valvular
lesions of the heart or diseases of the lungs, that obstruct
the return of the venous systemic circulation to the
right cavity of the heart, and catarrhal diseases of the pelvic
organs.</p>

<p>Biliousness or an affection of the liver, that interferes with
the portal circulation, or the pressure of tumors or swellings
on the uterine veins, are also among the causes, while the
accumulation of feces or habitual constipation is often overlooked
as too trivial to deserve professional notice, and yet
its removal is often the only successful means to cure the
patient.</p>

<p>The various eruptive and infectious diseases, like smallpox,
scarlatina, measles or typhoid fever, may excite in their
course a uterine catarrh, that will remain behind as a
chronic complaint, after the acute affection has subsided.</p>

<p>The acute variety of endometritis is much more prevalent
as a disease than is commonly supposed, but, owing to
an absence of specific or definite signs, pointing directly to
the mucous membrane, which the woman herself can recognize,
it is generally mistaken for something else.</p>

<p>The disease begins with signs of an active congestion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the pelvic organs; such as drawing pains in the small of the
back and in the groins, and a feeling of fullness and weight
at the bottom of the pelvic floor. The urine is voided with
pain and there is a sensation of heat in some parts of the
urethra. Pressure on the lower abdominal region is painful,
and the sensitiveness diminishes from the middle towards one
or the other side. In mild cases these symptoms are not accompanied
with fever, headache or a disturbance of the nervous
system; there may be diarrhœa due to reflex irritation
of the rectum, and the stools are accompanied with bearing-down
pain. After three or four days there is usually a discharge
of a viscid liquid, which in eight or ten days becomes
creamy, purulent and often tinged with blood. The
fluids that are discharged from the vagina sometimes become
so acrid and irritating that, when they come in
contact with the skin of the vulva, abdomen or thighs, it becomes
irritated and inflamed, which leads to excoriations
and an itching, that may spread over the entire body. The
reaction of this discharge is either acid or alkaline, depending
upon whether the discharge of the uterus or that of the
vagina predominates; as the discharge from the uterus is
always alkaline and that from the vagina always acid, there
is nothing of a practical diagnostic value in ascertaining the
chemical reaction of the secretion. The vagina will generally
be found to be hot and more or less swollen as in ordinary
vaginitis. The womb itself, however, will be enlarged
and sensitive, while the cervix is gaping or open.
Through the speculum, it is seen to be red and congested,
and from the gaping mouth there issues a clear, albuminous-looking
fluid or a muco-pus.</p>

<p>In the subacute or chronic form the symptoms are by
no means always so prominent as to indicate the existence
of the affection, or they are so marked, by some of the numerous
complications, which are in the nature of cause or
effect, that its recognition will become extremely difficult.
The effect which the disease has on the general organism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
varies greatly in different individuals. Some women of robust
appearance have an aggravated form of uterine catarrh
without any immediate ill effects on their nutrition or general
health. Other women lose flesh early and become
weak and worn; they become pale, and the face assumes a
yellowish ashen hue with dark rings under the eyes.
Through reflex irritation from the nerves of the uterus
other nerve centers become involved, so that a general
neurasthenia becomes developed with its characteristic concomitants
of neuralgia, muscular spasms, uterine colic and
hysteria.</p>

<p>With a third class the inflammation spreads from the
lining membrane to the substance of the womb itself, causing
an enlargement of the uterus, which induces displacements
and a dragging sensation in walking, pain in coitus
and painful defecation. The inflammation does not limit
itself to the womb, but an ichorous discharge creates distressing
symptoms of vaginitis, inflammation of the bladder,
and pruritus vulvæ.</p>

<p>When the uterine cavity is the seat of an abnormal vascular
activity, there often exist symptoms of pregnancy that
may mislead the patient or physician. Nausea and vomiting
are sometimes present, the darkening of the skin around
the nipples, and an enlargement and sensitiveness of the
breasts, meteorism, or a swelling of the abdomen, caused by
the accumulation of air in the intestinal canal from reflex
nervous irritation, and when this symptom is added to the
irregularity of menstruation, it is easy to fall into the error
of diagnosing pregnancy.</p>

<p>Sterility on the one hand, and habitual abortion on the
other, should direct attention to the probable existence of
endometritis. Very often barrenness has led to an investigation
of the condition of the uterus which disclosed the existence
of the disease. A woman who conceives, and then
loses her child in the first months of pregnancy, is afflicted,
in all probability, with a chronic endometritis. In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
cases, where conception takes place, it is to be presumed
that the sensitiveness and irritability of the inflamed mucous
membrane is not suitable for the permanent fixation of
the ovum, so that the slightest shock will open the flood
gates of a congested uterus, and thus the embryo is separated
from its attachment, and lost.</p>

<p>The cervix is sometimes the seat of a special feature of
uterine catarrh, that is due to the chronic inflammation of
the cervical mucous membrane, stimulating a growth or
proliferation of its own tissue or structure. This growth
causes an enlargement and elongation of the entire cervix,
and a spreading of the lining membrane of the cervical canal
to the vaginal surface of the cervix. This encroachment of
the cervical lining on the vaginal lining is the displacement
of the pavement epithelial cells of the vaginal portion
by the cylindrical or columnar epithelial cells of the cervical
canal, and this gives rise to <i>erosions</i> and follicular ulcers.</p>

<p>These erosions have a glandular arrangement, and are
often mistaken for cancerous or malignant growths. There
is no doubt in my mind, that most of the so-called successful
cures of cancer were nothing but cures of erosions.</p>

<p>The microscopists, whose lively imaginations make them
see things that do not exist, would make us believe that
they can take a small section of the suspected growth, and
establish the existence of cancer by microscopical examination;
this is utterly impossible, because the cancer cell is no
different from normal cells, and in erosions we often find the
follicles so close to each other, and their cells so closely
packed, one on the other, that no candid mind can say
whether it is a malignant or an innocent growth.</p>

<p>The claim that “nests of epithelium cells,” as the stereotyped
phrase goes, constitute scientific evidence of cancer, is
utterly absurd. Such eminent authority as Professor Arnold,
of Heidelberg, makes the assertion that positive diagnosis of
cancer, from a small section or scraping, is impossible. I am
myself fully convinced of the truth of this assertion, for while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
I was making microscopical studies in Germany, I had
abundant evidence of the truth of this statement. It is
indeed very unfortunate, both for science and suffering
humanity, that as yet there is no absolute means of diagnosing
cancer positively, and for that reason the quacks,
and those who are not quacks, will continue to fleece their
victims for supposed cancer.</p>

<p>I believe that the cause of cancer is either due to a <i>ptomaine</i>
or organic poison that is generated in the body, or to a
specific germ or bacillus. If it be due to the latter, and the
germ theory of disease makes that highly probable, there is
no doubt that a method of staining will soon be discovered,
that will make the specific microbe recognizable in the field
of the microscope, but as yet most cancer diagnoses by microscopy
are only surmises.</p>

<p class="psh">TREATMENT.</p>

<p>Continence in sexual intercourse is one of the prerequisites
to the successful treatment of all uterine diseases.
This is so often overlooked by those giving advice in such
matters, that their otherwise appropriate suggestions for
treatment are frustrated. The women who are suffering,
appreciate the value of this interdiction without further argument,
but the average man does not appear to have the
common sense to readily comprehend that the mechanical
irritation incident to the sexual act, and the accompanying
physiological congestion, will surely aggravate an inflammatory
process, no matter of what nature. Men, whose animal
instincts dominate their entire being, so that reason,
if they ever had any, is dethroned, should stop to consider
their immoderate conduct, which perpetuates the suffering
of their wives from ailments which men themselves have
often inflicted, and for which women are innocent martyrs.</p>

<p>The acute variety of uterine catarrh is to be treated like
all other acute inflammatory diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The patient should at once take to bed, so that she may
keep herself warm and quiet.</p>

<p>If the inflammation is due to cold or exposure during
menstruation, and the menstrual flow has been suddenly
checked, then three or four leeches, applied to the inguinal
regions on both sides, will be of decided advantage. Over the
lower abdominal regions hot compresses should be applied;
these are made by wringing cloths or a large folded towel out
of hot water, over which a piece of oiled silk, rubber, or oilcloth
is laid to retain the heat and moisture. At other
times, that is, when the inflammation is not due to cold
and a sudden stoppage of the menses, the application of ice
bags is preferable to the hot compresses, in the manner elsewhere
described.</p>

<p>The pains which are felt in different parts of the pelvis
are relieved by using the Femina vaginal capsules; say one
every six to eight hours, after a hot vaginal injection of
plain water, or a hot sitz-bath. If there is nausea or vomiting
that too is often relieved from the soothing influence
of the capsule which allays the nervous irritability.</p>

<p>Should the stomach not be in a condition to take nourishment
from biliousness or other causes, prescription No.
II on page 138 should be taken in tablespoonful doses every
four hours until the stomach is settled and the system regulated;
if any food is taken it should be between times and
of a liquid nature.</p>

<p>If there is straining or diarrhœa, I prefer to employ an
<i>enema</i> of one pint of warm German chamomile tea, to
which half a teaspoonful of McMunn’s elixir of opium or
laudanum is added. If the pain and straining are very
severe, one teaspoonful of either is not too much; by requesting
the patient to retain the enema for ten or fifteen
minutes, the medicine is directly absorbed, and the effect is
both soothing and healing. This may be repeated several
times a day, if the pain does not subside after the first injection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The bowels are sometimes found to be in an opposite
state, namely, constipated; this must be relieved at once. An
enema of warm soapsuds answers the purpose, or a half-tablespoonful
of warm water, in which a half-tablespoonful
of glycerine is dissolved, makes an excellent injection for
constipation.</p>

<p>Hot vaginal irrigations should be at once commenced,
and repeated as often as twice or three times a day. I always
dissolve a teaspoonful of powdered borax in the hot
water, of which no less than half a gallon is used at one
time; this is antiseptic and healing. After six or eight days,
once a day will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Chronic uterine catarrh or uterine leucorrhœa does not
require the active treatment which was recommended for
the acute form. It depends quite often on causes, whose removal
is absolutely necessary to the intelligent and successful
treatment of the affection.</p>

<p>The causes that have been enumerated must be carefully
and repeatedly reviewed, so that each individual case can be
traced to its source. Those causes that are improbable must
be eliminated from those that are probable, so that by a
gradual process of exclusion we narrow the number down to
those that actually exist. This simplifies the treatment to
actual conditions that can be intelligently met.</p>

<p>Vaginal irrigations constitute in the chronic form of the
disease an accepted and most useful therapeutic resource.
There is nothing that will ever contraindicate a thorough
cleansing of the vaginal canal, so that the organ may not be
bathed in its own morbid and irritating secretion. It is a
wholesome auxiliary to any course of treatment that may be
adopted. It avoids <i>self-infection</i> and places the pelvic organs
in the best possible condition for the healing powers
of nature to work out a cure.</p>

<p>If the uterine catarrh is the result of a venous obstruction
due to a congested liver and a general derangement of
the digestive apparatus, then any local treatment will be of
no avail without first removing the hepatic derangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Costiveness or constipation is a very common complaint
with women and a very painful cause of womb disease, but
it is so simple and ordinary in its nature that the wise will
not deign stoop to notice such trifles, but if it required for
its removal a surgical operation, for which a handsome fee
is the inspiring motive, then we should hear of it as often
as we do of lacerations or flexions of the cervix as a cause
of uterine catarrh, and its removal would then indeed become
absolutely necessary for effecting a permanent cure.</p>

<p>Why is it that the treatment of uterine disease has degenerated
into “professional faking” that is alike disgraceful
to the profession and a daylight robbery of the patient.
A woman, for instance, is suffering from what she supposes
to be <i>womb disease</i>. She consults a doctor, or what is still
worse, a time-serving specialist, who examines her and sees
at once signs of uterine catarrh.</p>

<p>He at once applies a little tincture of iodine or carbolic
acid diluted with glycerine or a solution of nitrate of silver
to the cervical canal. The woman is now informed that
this application must be repeated two or three times a week,
for which she must call at the office that number of times
every week, for an indefinite period. At each visit she is
subjected to the same routine humbuggery for local medication,
but does she get any better? In my early professional
experience I innocently and ignorantly tried these methods
myself, and I say no! But, as a matter of fact, this constant
irritation and poking around and into the womb will inflame
any healthy uterus, and much more one that is already
slightly irritated, so that patients lose their hope and
become convinced themselves that they are no better, but
feel worse than when they first commenced treatment.</p>

<p>This inefficient treatment, like the examination, is conjectural
and mechanical and therefore incomplete and
unscientific. The cause of her entire trouble is never
approached. The woman suffers for years from constipation,
which also inclines her to piles, because the pressure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
hardened feces on the hemorrhoidal veins obstructs the flow
of venous blood and the same pressure on the uterine veins
congests the mucous membrane of that organ and gives
rise to the symptoms of endometritis. All these conditions
should be inquired into, and many others, before local treatment
is decided on; simply running to the doctor’s office
and having these medical applications made to the cervix
or canal of the womb amount to nothing; this, as a general
rule, does only harm, and is as superfluous as if one were to
take a nasal douche of salt water or some other catarrh
remedy, whenever he feels a little cold in the head.</p>

<p>The proper course to pursue in this and similar cases is
to prescribe an appropriate diet, and regulate the bowels.
It is precisely in this way that women who have made the
rounds of the doctors, happen to take some patent laxative
or nostrum that relieves their constipation, and accomplishes
the <i>wonderful cures</i> of which we often hear and that were no
doubt Godsends to the sufferers that were cured, after all the
<i>first-class</i> doctors failed. By far the greatest proportion of
cases of uterine catarrh are of a simple and transient nature
and are only intensified by probing and local treatment.</p>

<p>When I first began the practice of medicine, I made the
same mistake in following the advice of books and those
who should have known better, for they have had ample
opportunity to be convinced of the <i>fallacy</i> of these local
measures in the great majority of cases, but some minds are
incompetent to learn from experience, for that requires close
observation, and logical reasoning.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that the catarrhal inflammations got
worse, in proportion to the trouble and pains I took to treat
them locally, so that I became ashamed of my ill success
and abandoned the local treatment entirely, and this I shortly
discovered was the means of curing them. Instead, I simply
directed patients to rinse themselves with quite warm salt
water, that is, a tablespoonful of ordinary cooking salt dissolved
in a gallon of water. Now I prefer Femina antiseptic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
lotion to the same quantity of water, which has greater healing
properties than either pulverized borax or common salt.
I particularly advised them to keep their feet and lower extremities
warm, regulating their diet and keeping their
bowels open. I noticed that the patients began to improve,
and that the improvement continued until they were fully
restored to health and vigor. This method of treatment
would not keep an office overcrowded with deluded patients,
but it proved far more satisfactory to all concerned than
meddlesome measures, and illustrated one of the most common
abuses to which suffering women are liable.</p>

<p>In taking a <i>laxative</i> patients must feel their way as to the
proper dose to take in their own individual case; constitutions
differ very much in this respect, so that it is impossible
to lay down one and the same rule for different persons.
It is not good practice to give medicines three or four times
a day in cases of habitual constipation, for it is liable to derange
the digestion and interfere with the appetite. The
proper method is one dose at bedtime and this should be
increased or diminished until the suitable dose of the remedy
has been ascertained; when this is accomplished, the dose of
the remedy should be gradually lessened, a few drops every
day, till it can be entirely dispensed with. If the ordinary
dose fails to relieve the bowels, an additional treatment of
glycerine enema at or about the time that the stool is to
take place is to be employed. One or two teaspoonfuls of
glycerine should be diluted with an equal quantity of
water, and by means of a hard rubber piston syringe
thrown into the rectum. The stimulating effect of glycerine
on the nerves and mucous membrane, materially assists in
relieving the torpor of the rectum, which has become insensitive
to the irritation of its natural contents.</p>

<p>Patients who are costive must get into regular habits of
relieving themselves, that is, have a regular hour every day
when to go to stool, then the medicine will in time cure the
most obstinate cases of constipation, otherwise it is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to cure it. It takes a constant amount of <i>effort to get
well</i>, so that those who are too indolent or think it too troublesome
to exert themselves, cannot hope to recover.</p>

<p>If there is great debility and impoverishment of the
blood, then I would advise prescription No. 1, which are the
<i>iron pills</i>, of which three pills should be taken three times a
day. The moderate use of wine, either claret or Riesling,
with the food, instead of tea or coffee, is very beneficial, between
meals a glass of Porter to relieve the <i>gone-in</i> feeling,
until the system has recovered sufficient strength to do without
it, that is when ordinary exertions are no longer a
burden.</p>

<p>The small percentage of cases that do not yield to the
above treatment, become legitimate subjects for an honest
specialist, for there may be extensive lacerations of the cervix
that require surgical treatment, or an elongated cervix
that should be amputated, or a granulated hypertrophied
membrane of the uterine cavity that should be scraped out;
all these operations are without danger if the operator has
thoroughly <i>mastered the details</i> of antiseptic surgery and has
the manual skill to do the work properly.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE NATURAL POSITION OF THE UTERUS AND
HOW IT IS SUPPORTED.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> uterus is not a stationary fixture in the female pelvis,
but enjoys a mobility within physiological bounds,
which in itself explains the great diversity of opinions
which may and do arise respecting the normal or abnormal
position of the womb in any given case.</p>

<p>When the surrounding organs and tissues of the womb
are in a healthy condition, and the abdominal walls are not
compressed by the weight and pressure of skirts, nor the
liver or diaphragm forced down towards the pelvis by a tight-fitting
corset, the organ is movable in every direction, without
the slightest pain or suffering.</p>

<p>The uterus is not tied down by any ligaments, as one
might imagine from a description of the several ligaments
that constitute only in a small degree its support, for it
changes its position in retching, coughing, breathing, singing,
walking and all other violent movements.</p>

<p>The question now naturally arises: What is the normal
position of the uterus, and what constitutes its natural supports?
To answer this interrogation is to controvert one of
the most baneful fallacies in gynecological practice, for the
amount of torturing and useless doctoring to which women
are constantly subjected, owing to some fancied displacement
of the womb, illustrates the force of precedent or of accepted
opinions, that were fortified by years of erroneous teaching.</p>

<p>It was supposed until quite recently that when the body
of the womb was inclined horizontally forwards, this was
unnatural or a sign of disease, until Prof. B. S. Schultze,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
director of the gynecological clinic of Jana, successfully
controverted this doctrine. In his work “<i>Die Pathologie und
Therapie der Lageverænderungen der Gebærmutter</i>,” which is
the most classical work extant on displacements of the uterus,
says: “From the <i>post-mortem</i> findings it was inferred that
the uterus occupied in the <i>living</i> woman the same position
as in the cadaver; such an assumption did not take into account
the actions of the muscles on the position of the uterus
in the living subject nor the intra-abdominal pressure which
is entirely absent after death, so that the dead organ naturally
gravitated backward after the remains had lain for
several days on the back.” Another observer, Dr. Hach,
found in a number of cases that he had examined during
life, the uteri bent forward or antiflexed; twenty-four hours
after death he discovered the same uteri in an opposite direction
or retroflexed.</p>

<p>This and similar subsequent researches have demonstrated
the fact that when the body of the womb rests on
the bladder it is not in an abnormal position as formerly
supposed and called <i>anteversion</i> or anteflexion, but that it is
natural for it to be so, and when the body is elevated and
its axis forms an obtuse angle with the horizon, the inclination
is a <i>post-mortem</i> condition.</p>

<p>With these precursory remarks I am now able to answer
the first clause of our query, and would say that the uterus
is in its normal position when its long axis is nearly parallel
to the horizon or at right angles with the perpendicular or
long axis of the body. The normal position of the uterus
is modified when the bladder is full or distended, for this
lifts the body of the uterus upwards, thus temporarily making
an acute angle with the vertical axis of the body, which
was formerly considered to be the permanent and natural
pose of the organ.</p>

<p>In referring to the bony pelvis, Plate I, it will be observed
that the same is in the nature of a canal, for the passage
of the child into the world. At other times than during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the child-bearing process, this canal must be effectually
closed to perfectly retain its contents. To accomplish this
purpose it is provided with a bottom or floor, which is to
give this necessary support, not only to the organs that
the pelvic cavity contains but also to the abdominal viscera
that are superimposed upon them. In order to accomplish
this, its outlet must be as effectually closed as the bottom of
a box or barrel in which material things are stored for the
purpose of carrying them from place to place. In the human
subject this bottom is called the pelvic floor, because
it serves the purpose of a bottom or floor to the pelvic canal.</p>

<p>The <i>pelvic floor</i> is not a simple structure but a complicated
arrangement of organs and tissues. If we begin to examine
it from below upwards, we first have its outer covering in
the skin; then, the superficial and deep fascias, the triangular
ligament of the bladder and a group of interlacing muscles.
The organs that enter into the composition of the
pelvic floor and interwoven with the preceding structures,
are the bladder, the vaginal walls, the rectum and connective
tissue. Examine Plate II.</p>

<p>Through this floor there are several openings, which are
guarded by a special set of constrictor muscles that are
termed <i>sphincters</i>. These are sufficiently strong in the bladder
and rectum but in the vagina they would be entirely
insufficient to close this canal effectually.</p>

<p>The vagina, or, for our purpose, it will be clearer if we say
“<i>vaginal canal</i>,” divides the pelvic floor into an anterior and
posterior segment, and it is by means of this division that
the whole structure of the pelvic floor is weakened; this will
be perceived at a moment’s reflection, when we compare it
with the pelvic floor of the <i>male</i>, who has no vagina; and for
this reason men are never troubled with the <i>prolapses</i> to
which women are liable. Nature, however, has made an
attempt to compensate this physical defect in a manner that
reduces the weakness occasioned by the vaginal canal to its
minimum. The vaginal canal does not enter the pelvic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
cavity in a directly upward or perpendicular course, but
obliquely upwards and backwards, as may be seen by referring
to Plate II. The result is that the intra-abdominal
pressure falls on the vaginal walls from above, and thus
compresses and approximates the anterior and posterior
walls of the vagina to each other, so that it constitutes a
self-closing valve, but, notwithstanding all these provisions,
this slit or opening through the pelvic floor still remains the
weakest point of the inclosure for the pelvic and abdominal
viscera. When the causes are sought that underlie the various
displacements of the uterus, they are generally to be
found in an impairment of the pelvic floor, through some
changes or accidents that are peculiar to pregnancy and delivery.</p>

<p>As we are also to inquire in the succeeding chapter into
the displacements to which the womb is liable, it would
greatly assist our understanding if we first got an idea of
what constitutes the natural supports of the uterus? The
word ligament is defined as anything that ties or unites one
thing or part to another; a bandage; a bond. This is the
<i>idea</i> in the popular mind, so that when the terms broad and
round ligaments of the womb are employed it is supposed
that they are for the same purpose for which ligaments are
usually intended. This is, unfortunately for a clear understanding
of the subject, a great mistake, because these ligaments
are an exception to the generally accepted meaning of
the term, for they neither tie nor support the uterus in its
natural position. One may readily imagine that this erroneous
conception would lead to a mistaken course in the
treatment of most cases of displacements, because too much
importance is bestowed upon structures that have no physiological
bearing on the disease.</p>

<p>Drs. Hart and Barbour, of Edinburgh, in their “Manual
of Gynecology,” which is the most scientific and practical
work that has lately appeared in the English language, have
this to say in speaking of the support of the uterus: “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
question of the support of the uterus is still disputed. The
broad and round ligaments have nothing to do with its
support, they are only useful as giving fixed points for the
contracting uterine muscles during parturition. The chief
support is the compact unbroken pelvic floor, on which the
uterus rests just as one sits on a chair. It is the whole pelvic
floor that supports the uterus and viscera, not the perineum
alone.” The perineum (see anatomical Plate II) is
only a small though strong part of the pelvic floor. If the
reader will now patiently review the organs that, together
with the other tissues, constitute this floor, and this can be
most profitably done by studying Plate II, there can be no
confusion of ideas whatever. In the following pages I have
occasion to refer to what is understood by the term pelvic
floor.</p>

<p class="pch">PROLAPSUS OR FALLING OF THE WOMB.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> one desires to familiarize himself with a thorough
understanding of this subject, it is absolutely necessary to
bear in mind what was said of the natural support of the
uterus, for unless one has a full knowledge of the foundation
of a structure, how can he comprehend its defects and
remedy them when the structure falls? The workman who
potters on a building that has shifted from its foundation
without first devising means for a new and solid basis for
it to rest upon, would be considered a fool. The term “falling
of the womb” has no longer the significance that it
once had, for it is only a symptom that something is wrong,
and in the present state of our knowledge it is misleading
and a misnomer, inasmuch as it conveys the impression
that it is due to an affection of the uterus, when as a matter
of fact it is not due to any disease of the womb at all. If
the prolapsed uterus has become involved in a morbid
process, it is the result of the abnormal conditions that have
brought the prolapsus about, and in which the uterus was
in no way concerned.</p>

<p>Professor Schroeder, of Berlin, takes a similar view of
these cases, and he groups into one chapter three distinct
varieties, yet, because one is depending on the other, he
considers them all as one disease. These affections are:
prolapse or falling of the womb; prolapse or falling of the
vagina, and an inflammatory elongation or <i>hypertrophy</i> of
the cervix or neck of the womb. He says “that the displacement
of the womb is very seldom a primary affection,
but that it is oftener the consequence of a prolapse or falling
of the vagina, and a giving way of other structures, or of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
pelvic floor, and, as such, ‘falling of the womb’ cannot be
properly separated into an individual affection of the
womb.”</p>

<p>Falling of the vagina is principally due to a widening
of the vaginal canal, a relaxation of its walls, and injuries
or lacerations of the pelvic floor. Lacerations of the perineum
generally occur during confinement, in which the
vagina tears through the vaginal orifice backwards towards,
or into, the rectum. This so weakens the pelvic floor that
it becomes inadequate to support the pelvic organs and
tissues, and this predisposes to all the varieties of <i>prolapsus</i>
that have been enumerated above. It is during the period
of gestation that the vagina grows considerably longer and
wider. In the latter months of pregnancy the womb ascends
and its body inclines greatly forwards, which naturally
tilts the cervix high up in the pelvis, and also draws that
portion of the vagina to which the cervix is attached with
it, but notwithstanding this upward dragging of the vagina,
the lower portion of the vaginal canal has so augmented
its proportions that it often protrudes between the lips of
the vulva during the last period of gestation. The normal
relation of the vagina to the neighboring organs is more or
less disturbed, that is, its attachment to the bladder and
rectum is stretched and loosened, so that under the most
favorable circumstances the mucous membrane of the lower
portion of the vagina falls out of the vulva or prolapses, of
course in the majority of cases only in such a degree that it
neither inconveniences nor is it noticeable by the pregnant
woman.</p>

<p>Immediately after confinement, in a healthy state of
affairs, nature should rectify these abnormal proportions,
that were only designed by her to serve a temporary purpose,
namely, to accommodate the child and provide for its
safe passage into the world. Medical writers have invented
a special term to designate this process of regeneration,
namely, <i>involution</i>. This means to infold or grow less so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
as to assume the former natural proportions of organs.
Unfortunately, nature is often contravened in her wholesome
regenerative purpose, by adventitious circumstances
that completely frustrate her intentions, and the reparative
process being thus balked, the organs and tissues remain in
their abnormal proportions, which constitutes now a disease,
and this uncompleted effort to repair is termed <i>subinvolution</i>.</p>

<p>It takes at least from six weeks to three months after
delivery for the reparative process or involution of the organs
and tissues to be completed. And women cannot exercise
too much care after confinement to avoid any possible
check to the regenerative process. If the involution has been
arrested, the vagina retains its large, flabby proportions, so
that its relaxed walls naturally protrude or prolapse, and
that entails all the other consequences.</p>

<p>Intra-abdominal pressure should be explained in connection
with this subject, for it constantly encourages prolapsus
of the organs under consideration. By that is meant
the pressure which the contents of the abdominal cavity
exert on its walls, and this is greatest at its most dependent
part, which is the pelvic floor. This pressure is continuous
on the organs of the pelvic floor while the woman is standing,
and greatest at the point of least resistance, which is the
relaxed and enlarged vagina, so that it bulges out at the
vaginal orifice. When the patient resumes a recumbent
position, this point is greatly relieved from pressure, and
the vagina may regain its normal relations, but whenever
the woman is in the upright position, the intra-abdominal
pressure will again force the weakened pelvic floor and
vaginal walls downwards. After a time the prolapse no
longer subsides after the pressure is reduced, for the tissues
have lost their recuperative power, and the prolapse becomes
permanent. When the intra-abdominal pressure is
supplemented by the action of the diaphragm and the contraction
of the abdominal muscles, as occurs in a long paroxysm
of coughing, repeated vomiting, and inordinate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
prolonged bearing down at stool, a prolapse may take place
quite suddenly, precisely as in a rupture or hernia, and for
these reasons some authorities (Drs. Hart and Barbour, of
Edinburgh) have described prolapsus of the womb as a <i>sacro-pubic</i>
hernia.</p>

<p>A permanent distension of the bladder or an accumulation
of feces in the rectum facilitates the development of a
prolapse of the vagina, because the former pushes the anterior
wall of the vagina downwards, while the latter depresses
the vaginal wall.</p>

<p>A large or subinvoluted uterus is by some considered as
a fruitful cause of prolapse; this Professor Schroeder denies,
and I am convinced from experience that he is right. A
uterus that is simply enlarged is not inclined to prolapse,
because the enlarged pregnant uterus never prolapses if the
pelvic floor is in a normal condition. But a chronic endometritis
or uterine catarrh may in time involve the vagina
in a vaginal catarrh and this may induce a prolapse. A
chronic vaginal catarrh or leucorrhœa can so relax the vaginal
walls that its lower folds protrude from the vaginal
orifice.</p>

<p>Women who are beyond the change of life and in whom
the lost elasticity of the tissues and a general absorption of
fatty and connective tissue has destroyed the natural support
which retains the vaginal walls, may be annoyed with
partial prolapses of the vagina.</p>

<p>The most aggravated types of prolapses are found among
the working classes, who cannot avail themselves of the
comforts and hygiene of the lying-in chamber that are so
essential for a complete and permanent recovery.</p>

<p>Elongation or hypertrophy of the cervix of the uterus is
the third variety of prolapses that Professor Schroeder includes
in the group. This form is consequent upon a falling
or prolapse of the vagina, and it occurs in the following
manner. The body of the uterus being retained by its
natural supports or by adhesion of a former inflammatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
process in the pelvic cavity, remains stationary where it
naturally belongs, while the upper end of the vaginal canal
being attached to and surrounding the cervix or neck of the
womb, gradually draws or stretches the cervix out, so that
it grows one or two inches longer than it is natural for it to
be. The cervix of the womb projects under these circumstances
down into the vagina, and in some cases it may be
seen between the lips of the vulva. This condition is mistaken
for falling of the womb, when in reality it is a falling
of the vagina with an incidental lengthening of the cervix
of the womb. To recognize and make these distinctions is
of the greatest practical importance, for thus alone can the
measures adopted for the relief of these distressing complaints
be successful.</p>

<p>The symptoms of prolapsus grow principally out of the
changed relations of the uterus to the surrounding organs
and tissues. The mechanical interference and pressure of
the womb on neighboring parts, and the changes that are
induced in the organ itself by the altered circulation in its
tissues, cause the inflammatory enlargement or hypertrophy
that is characteristic of one variety of the affection.</p>

<p>In some persons the development of the disease is so
gradual that it has progressed for years without any serious
inconvenience and the symptoms that did exist were generally
attributed to other causes. In the course of time there
is such a combination of morbid processes, like painful menstruation,
inflammatory enlargement of the womb and erosions
of the cervix with profuse leucorrhœa, as to render
the parts painful and sensitive to pressure and friction.
These symptoms excite in the end suspicion, so that the
sufferer may seek advice that will reveal to her the real condition
of her case.</p>

<p>Other signs of these affections are a dragging down or a
feeling as though a weight pulled the pelvic organs downwards;
there is also traction on the bladder, making this viscus
exceedingly irritable, so that there is a frequent desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to micturate; the rectum suffers also from similar traction.
There is another sign that is very often present, and particularly
in the early stages, and this is a feeling as if the vagina
was open; this is due to the relaxation of the vaginal
walls. Walking for any distance becomes burdensome and
causes great fatigue; pain in the back and loins is hardly
ever absent. There is an inability to lift weights, because
the pelvic floor cannot endure the extra strain that is superimposed
on the intra-abdominal pressure; ascending or descending
stairs aggravates the symptoms much more than
walking on the level floor.</p>

<p class="psh">TREATMENT.</p>

<p>This must be directed to the accomplishment of two
ends, without which no relief, much less a cure, is possible,
and these are, <i>first</i>, to return the displaced organ to its normal
position, and, <i>secondly</i>, to retain it there. The course first
indicated is, as a rule, not difficult to follow out; in fact, if
the patient is placed in a favorable position, the uterus replaces
itself through the natural forces of traction and gravitation,
unless it has become so enlarged that it is a physical
impossibility.</p>

<p>The “<i>knee-chest</i>” or “<i>knee-elbow posture</i>” is the term that
has been given to this position, and it is assumed in the following
manner.</p>

<p>The woman gets down on her knees, the thighs being
kept in an upright or vertical line; the object of this is to
keep the pelvis as high as possible, while the chest is bent or
inclined forwards until the head rests on the floor; the shoulders
must be as low to the floor as it is possible for the patient
to endure.</p>

<p>This position at once reduces the intra-abdominal pressure
on the pelvic floor to the least degree, and besides this,
the abdominal viscera gravitating towards the diaphragm,
the prolapsed uterus and surrounding tissues are drawn upwards
and forwards with it. If the prolapse was complete
or nearly so, so that the organ almost protruded through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the vulva, then the patient should retain this posture for ten
or fifteen minutes before an attempt is made to replace the
organ; for the intense congestion should be first allowed to
subside.</p>

<p>No sudden or violent force should be employed, but a
gentle, steady pressure. In cases where the organ has simply
descended into the vagina, the knee-chest posture alone will
replace the uterus. Those displacements that are due to a
chronic catarrh of the vagina are particularly suitable for
home treatment, because the patient can surely cure her
vaginal catarrh, and combining with this the knee-chest posture,
which should be practiced night and morning, for at
least ten minutes, and until the catarrhal inflammation has
entirely subsided, she has at her command the most useful
and beneficial resource to accomplish a cure.</p>

<p>If the reader will refer to page 179 and note carefully what
was said in this connection, she will learn that the phrase <i>falling
of the womb</i> is sometimes nothing more or less than a
relaxation of the vaginal walls that is due to a chronic catarrh
of the vagina. It is quite natural that it should be so,
for if the structures that make up the pelvic floor lose their
tonicity and strength, the womb must naturally descend. If
we now succeed in temporarily replacing the organ by assuming
the knee-chest position, and in the meantime cure the
catarrh and inflammation the patient must get well. The
reader is again referred to the chapter on vaginal catarrh.</p>

<p>The fatigue or lassitude which makes every physical
effort of some patients a great hardship, can be greatly relieved,
if not cured, by this formula.</p>

<p>Directions: A tablespoonful three times a day, between
meals.</p>

<p>When the prolapse is due to some of the structural defects
that were enumerated in the causation of displacements,
and that were traced to the accidents of childbirth,
then no permanent relief can be hoped for, until these defects
are remedied.</p>

<p>Pessaries or rings that are introduced into the vagina
for the purpose of stretching or spreading out the relaxed
folds of the vagina, that they cannot prolapse or fall down,
and thus indirectly support the uterus, were suggested by
the ancient fathers of medicine. In view of the fact that
they were wholly ignorant of the causes that were responsible
for prolapses, the remedy was quite practical and ingenious,
but to-day, when we are acquainted with the causes
that operate in bringing the prolapse about, they are, to my
mind, a very unsatisfactory <i>makeshift</i>, and afford only a
temporary amelioration.</p>

<p>A woman who is compelled to wear a ring or pessary is
certainly not well, and if she has any hard work to do or
must be on her feet a great deal, the pessary will sooner or
later so irritate the vagina that it must be removed. Besides
this, I always contended that, in the long run, this
extra strain on the vaginal walls would only relax them
more, and, instead of ever being able to dispense with the
use of a pessary, she must increase the size after a while.</p>

<p>There are a great many devices in the form of pessaries;
some of them are absurdly ridiculous, and more in the
nature of instruments of torture than of remedial expedients.
Since I learned to know better, I no longer recommend
them, and those who desire a radical cure for a prolapse of
any kind, will surely be disappointed if they pin their faith
to them.</p>

<p>I am convinced that they are a great source of evil, and
a sure index of ignorance on the part of those who habitually
recommend them. The German school of gynecologists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
have of late years greatly perfected the plastic operations
of the vagina, in fact, it is almost a sub-specialty in itself, to
which they have given the term <i>prolapse operations</i>. A
specialist, who is competent in the details of these prolapse
operations, can hold out the very best possible chance for a
radical and permanent cure, and while the operation requires
a certain degree of skill and special training, which
should be obtained by practicing these operations on the
cadaver, in order to save time, and not bungle the operation
on the living subject, as too often, unfortunately, happens.
In skillful hands, the operation is entirely without danger,
and under proper antiseptic precautions, the results are very
satisfactory.</p>

<p>The question is simply this: If the knee-chest treatment,
and the remedies that have been suggested, do not give permanent
relief, then there must be some such defect in the
pelvic floor as I have heretofore described.</p>

<p>If the vagina is too wide, it should and can be narrowed
to its normal dimensions, by removing the excessive tissue;
if the vagina is torn into the perineum, this too must be
united. Should the cervix of the uterus be abnormally
elongated, so that it makes it physically impossible to return
it to its natural position, it should be shortened or amputated,
and if all these three complications coexist, then an
operation combining and remedying all these defects, should
be performed at one sitting. This method alone will restore
the patient to health and usefulness.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pch">VERSIONS AND FLEXIONS OF THE UTERUS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Version</span>, in the nomenclature of diseases of the womb,
means that the entire organ without any deflection in its
normal axis turns, inclines or leans either forwards, backwards
or sidewards.</p>

<p>The prefix <i>ante</i> is used in the sense of forwards and in
composition with <i>version</i> we have the word <i>anteversion</i>, which
in conjunction with the term uterus, signifies that the organ
is inclined forwards. The prefix <i>retro</i>, signifies backwards,
and in composition with the word <i>version</i> and in connection
with the word uterus, it implies that the womb is turned
backwards.</p>

<p>The word <i>flexion</i> differs from <i>version</i>, inasmuch as it signifies
a bending or bowing, which breaks the normal axis
of the womb. The neck or cervix of the uterus may retain
its normal position, while its <i>body</i> is abnormally deflected or
bent in any direction. The prefixes <i>ante</i> and <i>retro</i> are also
used in composition with the word <i>flexion</i> as they are with
<i>version</i>. These distinctions should be remembered.</p>

<p class="psh">ANTEVERSION OF THE UTERUS.</p>

<p>In anteversion the uterus has so far changed its normal
shape that the cervix of the organ is stretched out or extended
in a line with the axis of the body. This occurs
when the uterus is unusually swollen from inflammatory
enlargement. The normal location of the body does not
materially change in these cases. It is a little more depressed
on the fundus of the bladder and the cervix is
correspondingly elevated, so that the latter stands considerably
higher than in health. If the bladder is empty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the patient bears down or does anything that increases the
intra-abdominal pressure, the body of the womb is forced
down, upon the anterior vaginal wall, which prolapses into
the vagina, while the cervix is raised, so as to point upwards
and backwards. When the bladder is full, the body of the
uterus is naturally raised, and the cervix correspondingly
depressed. And this is attributable to a rigidity or stiffness
about the organ, that is characteristic of a chronic inflammatory
enlargement of the uterus. Sometimes the organ is
permanently fixed by inflammatory adhesions, that lessen
or prohibit these movements.</p>

<p>The symptoms of anteversion are what may be expected
from an enlarged congested organ. This enlargement is
due either to a subinvolution of the uterus or to an inflammation
of the intermuscular substance, a chronic metritis.
One of the most annoying symptoms of the anteverted
uterus is the feeling of looseness in the pelvic cavity. This
is partly due to the relaxed state of the surrounding tissue,
and partly to the abnormal size of the womb. The patient
feels the organ roll from side to side, as she changes her position.
This causes unnatural sensations and mental suffering
that disturbs the nervous system and induces hysterical
complications. And the patient complains about something
moving in her abdomen.</p>

<p>The inflammatory adhesions that sometimes tie down
the organ in an anteverted position, compromise the normal
expansion of the bladder; this induces an irritation,
which causes a frequent desire to urinate.</p>

<p>The treatment must be directed to the removal of the
cause. This disease is really only a symptom or condition
of chronic corporeal metritis or subinvolution, and as such,
it is only amenable to the measures that will cure this disease.
The employment of rings and pessaries to remedy
this evil is contrary to good sense and of no permanent
value.</p>

<p>The intelligent employment of electricity, so as to stimulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the absorption of the hypertrophic enlargement of the
uterus and cause the absorption of the inflammatory adhesions,
will often give permanent and positive results.</p>

<p class="psh">ANTEFLEXION OF THE UTERUS.</p>

<p>This was considered at one time the most frequent of all
uterine displacements, not because it existed formerly oftener
than at present, but because the natural or normal position
of the womb was confounded with that which was supposed
to be abnormal.</p>

<p>The discovery that in the living subject the body of
the uterus naturally inclines forward, so as to rest on the
bladder, and that the body makes quite an angle with its
cervix, altered the conception of things very materially.
To-day an actual aggravated anteflexion, that occasions no
impediment to the menstrual discharge, is not a proper
ground for treatment, although this is as yet by no means
familiar to physicians in general, for many of them have
not learned to make the distinction.</p>

<p>The reader should carefully study Plate II, which diagramatically
illustrates how the body bows over the bladder
so as to show its natural anteflexion. If the angle between
the body and neck of the womb becomes too sharp or acute,
so that the canal of the uterus becomes compressed at the
point of flexion, in a degree that obstructs the escape of the
natural secretions of the uterine cavity, then the anteflexion
becomes a source of disease. This degree of flexion is happily
very rare, and we find it in about equal proportions due
to a congenital defect, that springs into prominence when the
girl arrives at puberty, for then the obstruction to the menstrual
flow is first realized.</p>

<p>The other class acquire the affection in adult life, after a
once healthy or natural menstruation has been established.
Of this class there are two species, which must be separately
analyzed, so as to avoid a confusion of ideas, that often
makes this subject, <i>which is the most simple</i>, one of the most
intricate, in the text books in gynecological practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>One variety of the acquired affection can be described,
in common with the congenital form, to which I first referred:
because the anteflexions in both cases are due to
precisely the same pathological conditions, namely, a loss
of muscular tone in the uterine walls, so that the organ becomes
flabby and weak, like a green wilted stalk, allowing
the body of the uterus to topple forwards.</p>

<p>The relaxation of the uterine walls is usually more pronounced
at that portion which is distinguished as the <i>isthmus</i>
of the uterus, and corresponds to that part of the organ
where the cervix goes over into the body, forming a sort of
natural hinge joint between body and neck.</p>

<p>If the bladder is empty, the body of the womb will
naturally drop, not necessarily forwards, for it may fall
backwards, but in the majority of cases it drops forwards,
because the womb is already inclined forwards in its natural
position, so all that is necessary to induce an excessive
anteflexion, is for the body of the uterus to sink lower than
it is natural for it to be. A kink or sharp bend will cause
in any canal an occlusion. Take a small rubber tube, for
instance, and bend it sharply at right angles; the result will
be at the corner of the deflection, that the tube will be flattened,
and its walls will come together. In the case of the
uterine canal, where there is an abnormal flexion, there is
precisely the same condition, and as a result an obstruction
not only to the menstrual fluid, but to the mucous secretions,
which are pent up in the uterine cavity. The retained fluids
decompose and irritate the mucous lining; and this entails
a complication of inflammatory diseases, which can never
be cured, unless the flexion is remedied.</p>

<p>The other variety of the acquired flexion is due to a
pelvic cellulitis. This is an inflammatory process, entirely
outside of the uterus.</p>

<p>The womb is surrounded by a great deal of loose cellular
tissue, that fills out the interspaces between the different
ligaments and pelvic organs. This tissue often becomes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
seat of an inflammation. The exudation from the inflammation
may be of such a nature that it forms strands of <i>fibrous
tissue</i>, running from the isthmus of the uterus backwards to
the sacrum. These strands contract or shrink in the course
of time, and this draws the isthmus of the uterus backwards,
and fixes or attaches it to the posterior pelvic wall. By this
contraction of the fibrous tissue the cervix is constricted and
the body falls unnaturally forwards.</p>

<p>The prominent symptoms of anteflexion are painful menstruation
and sterility. Dysmenorrhœa or painful menstruation
is the first sign of the existence of anteflexion at the
age of puberty. It happens that young girls are thus tortured
for days with violent uterine colic, that is occasioned
by spasmodic efforts of the uterus to force through the constricted
canal the pent-up secretion. This lasts until the
menstrual fluid has sufficiently dilated the cervical constriction
to allow its escape. These painful paroxysms of uterine
colic repeat themselves at each recurring menstrual
period, and through these repetitions of pain and suffering,
the general health becomes greatly deranged. The nervous
system becomes the seat of functional disturbances, and hysterical
disorders are not uncommon.</p>

<p>The organ becomes involved in chronic inflammatory
processes that make the uterus exceedingly sensitive, so
that the colicky pains become aggravated and prolonged
far beyond the cessation of the menses. Some of these patients
suffer for several weeks, from the time the courses
ought to begin, so that they are actually sick half the time.</p>

<p>Sterility is not an absolute certainty in all these cases,
but it is traced so often to an aggravated flexion, that it may
be accepted as one of its most prominent signs. Conception
has taken place in extreme flexions, because the spermatozoa
can gain admittance into the uterine cavity for several days
after the uterine colic and menstrual fluid have forced the
canal open. And if the uterus has not become involved in
inflammatory processes, then conception is the means by
which nature effects a cure through her own resources.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>During the menstrual period, the anteflected uterus becomes
greatly congested and swollen, and, having already
grown considerably larger from the chronic inflammatory
conditions which the anteflexion has induced, it impinges on
the bladder, so as to interfere with its free expansion. This
occasions a frequent desire to void urine, and this becomes a
very distressing symptom in a certain proportion of cases.</p>

<p>Treatment for this affection is not within the sphere of
the original purpose of this work, for the efforts at home
treatment must be aided by mechanical methods of the
physician. From what we are taught of the physical cause
of this affection, the fact seems self-evident that the acute or
sharp flexion must be modified to give permanent relief.
The employment of rings, pessaries, sponges or medical applications
are nonsensical, and the method of introducing a
stem in the uterine cavity, for the patient to wear for an indefinite
length of time, is not without great danger. Even
though a woman cannot give herself all the proper treatment,
it must be a great satisfaction to her to be informed of
the proper methods that should be adopted.</p>

<p>The vagina should be thoroughly rinsed before each
and every treatment of the uterus, so as to guard against
the possibility of infecting the cavity of the uterus.</p>

<p>If the manipulations that are required for the purpose
of carrying out some of the mechanical or surgical treatments
of uterine diseases, were always preceded with
thorough cleanliness, which implies <i>asepsis</i>, or without
putrescence, then all these operations would be shorn of
their greatest danger, namely, that of exciting inflammation
and suppuration.</p>

<p>If a probe of the usual curve can be readily introduced
into the supposed anteflected uterine cavity, then there cannot
be sufficient flexion to constitute an obstruction, hence
the flexion is not the cause of the disease. In genuine anteflexion,
the cervix and body of the uterus are doubled
up on each other, often like the letter V, the cervix representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
one line of the V, and the body the other; bi-mammal
palpation in the hands of an expert clearly establishes
this conformation.</p>

<p>When the diagnosis is established, the treatment should
be as follows: The patient is inclined on a table, either on
her back or side, a Sims’ speculum is introduced into the
vagina and the cervix exposed. The posterior lip of the
cervix is now seized by means of a tenaculum forceps, and
gently drawn downwards and backwards, which greatly reduces
or obliterates the angle or flexion between the cervix
and the body of the womb, this greatly facilitates the introduction
of a uterine electrode. After two or three treatments,
the forceps are no longer required because the electrode
can then be readily introduced into the uterine cavity
without them. The other electrode is spread on the abdomen.
(See this illustrated on Plate V.) A current of
electricity is now passed through the uterine tissues for ten
minutes; this is gauged all the way from sixty to one hundred
<i>milliampères</i>. The operation is repeated only once a
week, and the cure is effected in six weeks to three months.
Great care must be exercised during the treatment, to avoid
exposure and undue exercise.</p>

<p>Those forms that are due to inflammatory deposits and
strands outside of the organ, should be preceded with an
electrical treatment twice a week, somewhat modified from
the preceding course. This is done by employing a <i>vaginal
electrode</i>, properly protected and gently pressed against the
adhesions. The other <i>electrode</i> is applied to the small of the
back. A current some fifty <i>milliampères</i> stronger is passed
directly through the adhesions; when these are absorbed,
the intra-uterine electrode is employed, as in cases that are
not complicated with them.</p>

<p class="psh">RETROVERSION OF THE UTERUS.</p>

<p>This consists in a posterior inclination of the uterus, so
that the body of the womb approaches the posterior walls of
the pelvis, while the cervix of the womb is raised against the
base of the bladder.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Retroflexion of the Uterus, or the Womb, bent backward.</p>
       <p class="cap2">This plate elucidates the womb bent or turned backward and pressing on the
rectum. This condition is generally traceable to the vicious custom of lying on the
back after confinement or during childbed. The natural position of the organ, inclined
forward and resting on the bladder, is also shown.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>As a permanent pathological lesion, this form of displacement
is very rare, but as a forerunner of retroflexion it is of
frequent occurrence. The length of time that elapses for a
version to take on a flexion depends on the degree of induration
or stiffness of the uterine walls.</p>

<p>The chronic inflammatory enlargement of the uterus
predisposes the organ to posterior displacement, and the displacement
favors the development of flexion. This takes
place in the following order: After the uterus is displaced
backwards, and its cervix has become fixed by inflammatory
adhesions, the body of the womb gradually glides down
on the posterior pelvic wall, from gravitation and intra-abdominal
pressure. And in this very simple manner a
retroversion is converted into a retroflexion. The causes,
symptoms, and complications that characterize this variety
of displacement, with its subsequent modification into flexion,
are the same as those of retroflexion, to which the
reader is referred.</p>

<p class="psh">RETROFLEXION OF THE UTERUS.</p>

<p>This form of uterine displacement exists when the body
of the womb is bent towards the posterior wall of the pelvis,
which is in an opposite direction to that where it naturally
belongs. I have already pointed out, in speaking of the
normal position of the uterus, that the body is directed forwards
and rests on the bladder, while its cervix points
downwards into the pelvic cavity. I now refer you to Plate
IV, in which I plainly show the uterus in a directly opposite
position to that in health, namely, turned back, resting
on and depressing the rectum.</p>

<p>In retroflexion the cervix of the uterus continues to point
downwards, into the pelvic cavity, in almost the same direction
as in the natural position, while the body is directed
backwards, or backwards and downwards. We seldom, if
ever, find this condition as a congenital affection, but as an
acquired displacement it is undoubtedly more frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
met with in gynecological practice than all other displacements
combined. The round ligaments of the uterus were
at one time, and are even yet by some, supposed to be the
means that retain the womb in its normal anteflected position.
Upon this theory a new surgical operation sprung
into prominence for the relief of this class of cases. It was
reasoned, that if the round ligaments actually tied the uterus
down, and retained it in its natural anteflected position, that
to shorten these ligaments by opening the inguinal canal in
the groin, and drawing them out, would remedy a displacement
of the womb, whether a prolapsus or a retroflexion.
This operation was performed, it was claimed successfully,
and if the view that the round ligaments retain and support
the uterus were a correct one, it must be admitted that the
operation would have been <i>ideal</i>. I convinced myself, however,
of the utter fallacy of this position, in dissections on the
cadaver, where in several instances the round ligaments
could not be reached without opening the abdominal cavity,
and even then it was impossible to trace them. These
views were expressed in an article in the <i>American Journal
of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children</i>, and as the
operation fell shortly afterwards into merited disrepute, I
partly claim the credit of having been instrumental in
bringing that about. I said:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“That this ligament has nothing to do in fixing the
uterus in its normal anteverted position, is proven from
many facts which occur in daily practice. The insertion or
origin, whichever one chooses to call it, of these cords at the
groin, is somewhat irregular and sometimes so rudimentary
that it cannot be found upon a most careful and tedious
dissection. It may be found divided into a number of processes,
one being connected with Poupart’s ligament in the
inguinal canal, the other being lost in the labia majora, and
another may be traced to the sheath of the rectus muscle.</p>

<p class="pbq">“If these cords were so important as the advocates of the
Alexander-Adams operation try to make us believe, in binding
the uterus forward, and, as we are recently informed,
have a strength equal to support four and one-half pounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
weight, a great deal of uneasiness, if not actual pain, would
be felt and located along the inguinal canal, following this
structure to its points of insertion, in sudden dislocations of
the uterus backwards. This is, however, not the case; when
sudden painful symptoms arise, they are invariably referred
to the sacral region. In sudden retroversions or flexions,
as in the pregnant uterus, occurring accidentally or those
retroverted or flexed uteri which are so often met with in a
state of subinvolution after confinements, there are no symptoms
pointing to a tension of these cords at all, but all
symptoms point to uterine pressure on the posterior pelvic
wall, which can be precisely located. And these pains disappear
as soon as the offending member is put right.”</p>

<p class="p1">There is no doubt that the uterus retains its abnormal
retroflected position by the same forces that keep it in a
normal or anteflected state; these are (1) intra-abdominal
pressure, and (2) the force of gravitation of its own weight.</p>

<p>In some women there are certain predispositions to the
occurrence of a retroflexion. If the walls of the uterus are
weak and relaxed, especially that portion where the cervix
unites with the body of the womb, then the body may fall
in any direction, and, as the bladder is liable to be distended,
and thus raise the body of the uterus upwards, folds
of intestine are likely to intervene, so that the organ is inclined
backwards, and the abdominal pressure, now falling
on the anterior surface of the body, presses the womb backwards
and downwards into a flexion.</p>

<p>A fall backwards or a violent push or jump may cause
retroflexion any time during life. Retroflexions of this nature
are not as a rule injurious, and if the circulation is not
compromised, nor the uterine canal obstructed, women may
go through life without feeling any the worse because their
womb occupies an abnormal position. It is only when the
organ is congested and swollen, so that its own tissue is painfully
sensitive, and the surrounding tissues are compressed
by the foreign body, that it requires measures for relief.</p>

<p>In those women who have borne children, and those
who have gone through a miscarriage, retroflexion is frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
met. A little reflection will make this clear, for
when we remember how the pregnant uterus at any time
from conception to final delivery becomes congested and
the seat of a corresponding growth of its own tissue to accommodate
the growing fetus, we at once perceive that
either after an abortion or on delivery at full term, the enlarged
and congested uterus is in the best possible condition,
to lose its normal place and sink backwards. The pernicious
custom in vogue in most countries, of keeping a
woman on the flat of her back after delivery, has never been
as vehemently opposed by the intelligent members of the
profession, as the gravity of the subject demands. Some
women have an idea that the longer and quieter they remain
on their backs, the surer they are to make an excellent
recovery from the lying-in chamber. American and English
practitioners are inclined to recommend this as the
most proper way to lie, but there is no doubt that this not
only favors the occurrence of retroflexion, but that it actually
causes it.</p>

<p>The woman who rests on her back gives to the heavy
body of the womb an opportunity to sink backwards, after
the distended bladder has pushed the organ high enough up
so that its own weight may throw it over, until it finds resistance
on the posterior wall of the pelvic cavity. Many nurses
insist on the dorsal position for days, and never permit the
patient the privilege of lying upon one or the other side.
Aside from the injurious effect that this has on the position
of the uterus, it is exceedingly tiresome to be compelled to
remain for several days in one position. Women should be
allowed to lie on all sides, after delivery, and no longer on
one side than on another. And to insure against a retroversion
or flexion, she must also lie on the abdomen a certain
length of time during each twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Tight bandaging after delivery, for “preserving the figure,”
greatly aggravates the displacement; the binder should
be so applied that it feels comfortable but not too tight, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
purpose being to offer a gentle support to the suddenly relaxed
abdominal muscles, and thus stimulate them to contract
to their normal form.</p>

<p>The symptoms of retroflexion are greatly varied by the
pathological conditions that affect the uterus, or by the complications
that may have caused the flexion.</p>

<p>It is indisputable that the uterus may be retroflected for
an indefinite length of time without causing any inconvenience.
From this it may be inferred that the retroflection
itself does not constitute the disease, but the inflammatory
processes, in which the organ is involved, or the relaxation
of the adjacent structures, as we find them immediately after
confinement, constitute the actual diseased conditions.</p>

<p>One of the most constant symptoms is pain in the back,
and this is severe in proportion to the swelling and sensitiveness
of the organ, when it presses on the sacral nerves
and rectum.</p>

<p>As a result of the flexion, the circulation in the organ is
interfered with, so that the congested uterus feels heavy,
and there is a sensation of fullness and bearing down, that
greatly hinders walking. Uterine catarrh and hyperæmia
place the organ in such an irritable state that prolonged
and excessive menstruation is the rule. This may last for
fourteen days, so that the patients become anæmic and
greatly debilitated from the excessive loss of blood. The
menstruation is always more painful, especially at the beginning
of the flow; this pain may be interrupted or spasmodic,
so that it assumes the form of a uterine colic; the
lower abdominal region becomes painful and the pain radiates
towards the groins. The degree of suffering is very
seldom as great as that which characterizes anteflexion, because
the obstruction in the latter flexions are much greater
than in retroflexions.</p>

<p>Those women who have borne children suffer less pain
during menstruation than those who have never been pregnant.
It may be presumed that, in the latter class, the flexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
was congenital or acquired in early childhood, which
makes the obstruction or constriction more complete and
obstinate, and for that reason it induces sterility. With
those who have once borne and afterwards acquired the flexion,
the possibility of conception is much greater.</p>

<p>When the enlarged and swollen body of the uterus is
pushed backwards and downwards, it presses on the sacral
plexus of nerves; this is a bundle of nerves that supplies
branches to the legs, and from this pressure the lower extremities
become lame or paralyzed either on one or both
sides. The paralysis subsides after the removal of the offending
body. There is quite a number of other neurotic
affections that can often be traced to a retroflected uterus.
These are all of a functional nature, and appear in the form
of hysteria, epilepsy, St. Vitus’ dance and neuralgias of almost
any part of the body. Dr. Chrobak, of Vienna, reported
a case of asthma that had resisted all the treatments that
could be suggested, until it was finally traced to a retroflected
uterus; that being rectified, the asthma subsided.</p>

<p>Irritability of the bladder is not so frequent a symptom
of this variety of displacement as of others; should there be
inflammation complicating the bladder, then, of course,
there would be considerable annoyance from this source.</p>

<p>Habitual constipation is often very prominent and in
some of the cases it is the only sign that leads to an examination,
which reveals the retroflexion. Hemorrhoids or
piles, due to a compression of the veins of the rectum, are
another complication included in the signs of this displacement.</p>

<p class="psh">TREATMENT.</p>

<p>There is a small proportion of cases in which the system
has become accustomed to the retroflected position of the
womb, and if the abnormal condition is rectified, a great
many painful symptoms spring into prominence, that are
attributable to the interference. This is particularly the
case in women who are in those years that we term “change
of life,” and for this reason they should be let severely alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Excluding the above class of cases, the question arises in
other cases whether the uterus can be replaced without
violence, or whether it is fixed or grown to its surroundings
by inflammatory adhesions. It is not always an easy
matter to dispose of this question at once, because the enlarged
and congested body is often so firmly wedged down
between the posterior pelvic wall and the vagina, that any
attempt to dislodge it is accompanied with such acute pain
that one feels constrained to desist for a time. When there
is great pain or sensitiveness, the patient should take to bed,
so as to give the pelvic organs every chance to get rid of the
inflammatory irritability. Hot-water compresses should be
applied to the lower abdominal or pelvic region, and hot
vaginal irrigations thrown into the vagina; these should be
copious, no less than a gallon of water at once, at a temperature
of 107 to 110° Fahr., repeated twice daily. The bowels
should be kept loose, say several operations each day,
for three or four days; after that once a day will be sufficient.</p>

<p>In the course of several weeks the congestion will have
subsided, so that, in the great majority of cases, reposition
can be readily accomplished. If the resistance of the womb
still persists, then it is reasonable to infer that the organ is
tied down by old inflammatory adhesions; these, then,
should be treated with galvanism, after the manner described
for removing adhesions in anteflexions.</p>

<p>The statistics show that, out of every five women who
are suffering from female diseases, one has a posterior displacement,
either a retroflexion or retroversion. The greatest
number of these are traceable to their last confinement.
All these displacements, as well as those that are accidental
or induced by a fall, jumps or the like, should be replaced
as soon as possible, otherwise inflammatory adhesions may
complicate and greatly obstruct the replacement.</p>

<p>The reposition or replacement of the womb may be accomplished
through natural agencies, that can be employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
by the patient herself. These are, in a great measure, the
same forces to which the womb’s posterior displacements are
to be attributed, namely, intra-abdominal pressure and gravitation.
To employ these for the purpose of remedying the
evil, the so-called knee-chest position must be assumed by
the patient. The first step towards assuming this position
is to get down on the bended knee, the thighs in a vertical
position, then the body is gradually inclined forwards until
one or the other shoulder touches the floor or level of the
knee. If this position is retained for ten minutes it will
alone replace the organ forwards, sometimes suddenly, at
other times gradually, provided the organ is moveable and
not squeezed into the pelvis or adhered by inflammatory exudation.</p>

<p>Dr. Henry F. Campbell, of Georgia, introduced this natural
therapeutic agent into the profession, but it appears to
be very little known or understood by the profession, perhaps
because it is so very simple. Dr. Mundé, in an article
on “Uterine Displacement and Its Curability,” in the <i>American
Journal of Obstetrics</i>, indorses the knee-chest or knee-shoulder
position in the following language: “A moment’s
thought will demonstrate the utility of this combined <i>vis a
fronte</i> (gravitation of the abdominal viscera towards the diaphragm)
and <i>vis a tergo</i> (air suction into the vagina and pressure
against the vaginal roof). This position is to be assumed
several times daily, and maintained each time as long
as the patient can bear it, continued for months, if necessary;
the best time is at night at retiring, when the lateral
position is to be taken for the night.”</p>

<p>In a certain proportion of cases the knee-chest position
alone will not dislodge the retroflected uterus, so that manual
aid is required to effect that purpose. There is a number
of methods that have been suggested from time to time,
but none are so good as that in which the knee-chest position
is combined with the manipulation of the operator. Reposition
may occur spontaneously, and it undoubtedly does in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
large proportion of cases, in which the retroflected organ becomes
pregnant. When the retroflected organ occasions
symptoms of retention of urine, the bladder should first be
emptied with a soft No. 8 catheter, then the patient is directed
to kneel on both of her knees, her thighs remaining
perpendicular, while her body inclines forward until one or
the other shoulder touches the floor or level of her knees.
The operator may then gradually lift the womb and elevate
the body sufficiently so that it will fall forward into its natural
place. When there is no bladder trouble from compression,
and the womb resists even mild force to replace it, I
have accomplished gradual reposition by keeping the woman
in bed for three or four weeks, with the instructions that she
resume the knee-shoulder position two or three times a day,
and from five to ten minutes, also that she shall lie on her
side and chest and never on her back. In this manner I
have accomplished in time and without force what could
not have been accomplished with forcible attempts without
inducing an abortion.</p>

<p>It curiously happens that there are cases of retroflection
which are never suspected nor recognized until the patient
has become pregnant. After the woman is about three
months gone, the growth of the pregnant uterus can no
longer be accommodated in the pelvis, because the direction
of its growth is in the direction of the retroflected organ,
namely, backwards and downwards (see Plate IV) which
makes it a physical impossibility to escape from or grow out
of the bony pelvis. The symptoms are retention of urine
or a constant dribbling of urine and a straining at stool or
pain in the rectum or pelvis, and, of course, the absence of
the menses since the commencement of pregnancy. Retroflection
may be also acquired during the first three or four
months of normal pregnancy, from a jump or fall on the
back, in which all the symptoms that indicate this condition
are suddenly manifested.</p>

<p>In pregnancy, the course that is to be pursued, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
to rectify the displacement, must be obviously different
from that pursued when the woman is not pregnant. The
pregnant uterus is a “touch me not;” it permits of no tampering
without running the fearful risk of inducing an abortion,
and no one but a tyro or an ignoramus will ever
meddle with the pregnant womb.</p>

<p>The replacement of the retroflected uterus, that is positively
not pregnant, and there must be no question about it
either, will admit of introducing a sound into its cavity.
This sound is used as a lever upon which the organ may be
lifted out of its abnormal position and inclined over the
bladder in an anteflected position, which is its natural one.
The sound which I employ, and which is my own invention,
for replacing the uterus is screwed into a thimble, and from
two and one-half to three inches long. The object of this
is to artificially elongate the finger so that it can be introduced
into the womb. The force which one employs by
using this instrument is keenly appreciated by the operator,
hence there can be no undue strain, that otherwise might
be exerted on adhesions which are too strong to be safely
lacerated or even stretched, while slight and recent adhesions
might be torn without any bad results. Truax, of Chicago,
manufactures my repositor.</p>

<p>Before introducing any sound into the uterine cavity, it
is absolutely necessary that the vagina should be thoroughly
cleansed with borax water.</p>

<p>The inflammatory enlargements of the womb, subinvolutions,
uterine catarrhs, and any of the complications that
may exist at the time that the organ is replaced, should be
treated on the same principles that have been laid down in
the respective chapters on these diseases; in fact, these complications
constitute part of the after treatment for retroversion
or flexion. The other treatment is to be directed toward
retaining the womb where it naturally belongs. The daily
exercise in the knee-chest position should never be neglected,
and in cases in which this is insufficient, it is very probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
that the pelvic floor or natural support of the uterus has
been injured or lacerated during confinement, and this may
require a plastic operation as a preliminary to a cure. In
obstinate cases there is no cure so effectual as pregnancy
and a full-time delivery, provided precautions are taken so
that the mother will not acquire a new retroflexion during
her lying-in period, from the cause that has been already detailed.
The patient must accustom herself to sleep either on
the chest with face turned to one or the other side, or in a
semi-prone position on either the right or left side. Perseverance
in sleeping in this manner for a few weeks cultivates
the habit that gives more refreshing sleep than lying on the
back, which most persons are inclined to do.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="pch">DISEASES OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Fallopian tubes are the ovi ducts, along which the
spermatozoids pass from the womb to fertilize the ovum,
and along which the fertilized or non-fertilized ovum, as
the case may be, is carried to the cavity of the uterus.</p>

<p>They are two small canals, between three and a half and
four inches in length, and constitute the only means of communication
between the womb and ovaries; their caliber is
exceedingly small and lined with a delicate mucous membrane.</p>

<p>The diseases which affect the Fallopian tubes are inflammation,
stricture, distention and displacements.</p>

<p>The inflammation is distinguished as salpingitis, from
<i>salpinx</i>, Fallopian tube, and <i>itis</i>, in composition, inflammation;
this consists of a catarrhal inflammation of the lining membrane
of the tubes, which rarely if ever originates in the
tubes themselves, but is secondary to an inflammatory process
in the neighboring organs.</p>

<p>Chronic endometritis or catarrh of the womb is undoubtedly
the most fruitful cause of salpingitis, although this is
not absolutely the rule, for there are some women who have
had uterine catarrh for years without its affecting the tubes
in the least. But there is a type of uterine catarrh that has
a special tendency to spread from the womb to the lining
membrane of the tubes, and this is the infectious endometritis.
An infectious inflammation of the womb may be
due to many different sources of infection; the retained
products of conception after an abortion may become putrescent
and furnish one source; carrying putrefactive germs
into the uterine cavity from the vaginal canal by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
probes or instruments, that are in themselves defiled by not
having been thoroughly cleansed and purified since their
last employment, is another source of infection; the latter
is perhaps the commoner cause of blood poisoning in
criminal abortions by the abortionists. Gonorrhœal infection
seems to have a greater tendency than any other to
spread itself from the uterus to the tubes; this has been the
subject of special inquiry, and has been thoroughly confirmed,
and this may arise many months after the infected
male has imagined himself entirely cured.</p>

<p>The diseases of the tubes that I have enumerated are in
the relation of cause and effect; a catarrhal inflammation
is quite likely to induce a stricture or an occlusion, and
this causes a distention from retention of the secretions,
whether the secretions are a natural or an inflammatory
product. If the inflammation has an infectious origin, then
the retained secretion becomes purulent, or it may be a
muco-pus secretion from the commencement. The dilated
tube may also contain blood or serum; the latter constitutes
tubal dropsy; or it may contain a fertilized ovum; this gives
rise to tubal pregnancy.</p>

<p>Tubal dropsy may be a distention of the tubes when
both ends are sealed by inflammatory adhesions; these distentions
vary in size from the thickness of a finger to a
large ovarian tumor, from which it is not an easy matter to
distinguish it.</p>

<p>The most dangerous form of tubal obstruction and distention
is where the contents are pus or purulent matter; this
is liable to be poured into the peritoneal cavity from ulceration
or rupture of the sac, and excites fatal peritonitis.</p>

<p>Salpingitis can only be viewed as a complication of some
prior inflammatory process in some of the adjacent organs
and tissues; these are the uterus and ovaries and the pelvic
peritoneum and pelvic cellular tissue.</p>

<p>The symptoms of inflammation of the tubes are not so
clearly defined as to indicate the nature of the affection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
because it is hardly ever limited to the tubes alone, the surrounding
tissue being always more or less involved. These
patients are so seldom free from pain that their lives are a
constant suffering. If the pain subsides, it is only for a few
days, and the slightest exertion brings about a relapse, so
that walking or standing must be avoided. During menstruation
the pain always increases, and the menses may be
excessive at one period and scant at another; these harassing
pains make powerful inroads on the patient’s strength;
she becomes pale and debilitated, while her emaciated form
and careworn expression give us a picture of the typical invalid.
Fortunately, this complication is not as frequent as
one might expect from the intimate relation of the tubes to
the womb and ovaries, but the possibility of the Fallopian
tubes becoming inflamed should admonish women against
taking any chances by neglecting the rules of hygiene, that
I have laid down in another chapter, for the old saying that
“prevention is better than cure” is only too true of this
malady.</p>

<p class="psh">TREATMENT.</p>

<p>The curative measures for inflammatory diseases or abscesses
of the tubes have not been, on the whole, until within
a comparatively recent period, very satisfactory.</p>

<p>When this affection complicates uterine or vaginal catarrh,
then the treatment that is recommended elsewhere
for the relief of these complaints should be adopted; quietude
is of paramount importance, and total continence must be
practiced by the sufferer. Hot sitz baths and warm fomentations
are important auxiliaries in the treatment. Vaginal
irrigations of hot water, night and morning, relieve the congestion
and stimulate the absorbents of the pelvic glands.
Femina vaginal capsules are a great assistance towards accomplishing
the same end; one capsule introduced into
the vagina at bedtime should be combined with the other
treatment.</p>

<p>If these measures fail to accomplish a cure, then a surgical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
operation may be required as a last resort, which consists
in extirpating the diseased tubes and ovaries.</p>

<p>This operation has given some brilliant results, but it has
also hurried a great many to an untimely grave. Fool-hardy
surgeons or operators are the rule; doctors of only
mediocre talent worm themselves into positions that give
them prestige in the community. Where nature refuses a
capacity for the acquirement of solid wisdom, she seems to
compensate her creatures by endowing them with faculties
for cunning and intrigue, that galvanize the spurious into
the apparently genuine. They have charge of hospitals
and are professors in colleges, and are ambitious to imitate
the operations of the European masters. On the other
hand are the statistics of able surgeons, who seem to have
an inborn genius for a special line of operations; such a one
is Lawson Tait, of Birmingham, and Martin, of Berlin.
Tait has had phenomenal success in cutting open the
abdomen and removing diseased tubes and ovaries. He
possesses the faculty and skill to select only those cases that
are especially suited for an operation, and those that are not
adapted for the knife are excluded. In the exercise of this
judgment the danger of the operation is reduced to a,
minimum. The tubes and ovaries are often so matted and
tied down with inflammatory adhesions, that their removal
means sure death, and does the average surgeon know this?
To have the genius of a Tait is to be one in ten thousand,
and for this reason his statistics should be neither a guide
nor an excuse for the other nine thousand nine hundred
and ninety-nine, to attempt to do as he does. To assume
that they can, is as absurd as to admit that our indigenous
colonels of the State militia can plan or execute the campaigns
of Napoleon.</p>

<p>Galvanism or electricity has come to the rescue of this class
of cases, as a safe and reliable method of treatment; of
course it takes more time and patience. Should not this
outweigh the selfish ambition of the unscrupulous surgeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
who desires to boast of the number of times he has opened
the abdomen, with little compunction of the confiding lives
that he has sacrificed?</p>

<p>I have myself had abundant experience to be convinced
of the usefulness of electricity as a curative agent in this class
of diseases, but I prefer to illustrate the treatment by quoting
from a paper on “The Value of Electricity as a Substitute
for Laparotomy,” by Augustin H. Goelet, M. D., in the
New York <i>Medical Journal</i>. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mrs. T., aged twenty-six. Severe pelvic pain referred to
left side; profuse leucorrhœa; prolonged and painful menstruation.
Diagnosis: Pyosalpinx (or pus) in the left tube.
Laparotomy (opening the abdomen) advised at Woman’s
Hospital. Treatment: Tube emptied into the uterus by
applications of positive galvanism to the left horn of the
cavity of the uterus. Intravaginal applications afterwards,
completed the cure. Duration of treatment, four months
Complete relief of pain followed the removal of the pus from
the tube. At the end of the treatment she had completely
regained her health. Menstruation was normal, and symptoms
relieved.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="pch">DISEASES OF THE OVARIES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is an analogy in the reproductive apparatus, running
through the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.
The bulb at the lower extremity of the pistil of a flower is
called the ovary, and it contains the seed, which in the
course of development becomes the fruit.</p>

<p>In the human female, the ovary contains the seed, or germ,
which, becoming fertilized, develops into the human embryo,
or the fruit of conception.</p>

<p>The seeds of the ovaries are termed ova, or eggs, and the
organ or gland in which the germs, or eggs, are prepared is
the ovary.</p>

<p>In the human female the ovaries are two follicular
glands, about the shape and size of small almonds, situated
on each side of the uterus. The follicles, or small sacs, of
which the ovaries are composed, are cemented together by
delicate fibrillar connective tissue, which is known as the
<i>stroma</i> of the ovary, while the follicle is termed Graafian
vesicle, after the name of its discoverer. Professor Barry,
another investigator, gave the follicles the much better and
more appropriate designation of ovisacs, because each of
these capsules or follicles contains a single ovule, or little
egg.</p>

<p>It is carefully estimated that there are 30,000 Graafian
follicles or ovisacs in each ovary, of which only an insignificant
number develop and rupture at each menstrual
period. It appears, from the researches of Valentine and
Pflueger, that the Graafian follicles are formed at a very early
period of embryonic life, from a series of minute tubules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that gradually become constricted from surrounding stroma,
at regular intervals; the ova are subsequently developed in
the interior of the follicles.</p>

<p>Ovarian cysts or tumors cannot be considered in a work
for home treatment, but a desire must be awakened in the
minds of thoughtful readers, to learn the origin of these
growths, and it seems to me quite appropriate at this juncture
of the subject, to state that Professor Waldeyer, of Berlin,
has discovered that ovarian tumors are developed from the
remnants of the little tubules from which the Graafian
follicles originate, so that the cause or source of these tumors
is already laid before the patient is born; hence cannot be
attributed to any fault on the part of the afflicted person.
From the earliest period of intra-uterine development up to
the age of puberty, the growth of the ovaries is entirely
passive, but after that a continuous change takes place in the
substance of the ovaries; the contents of the ovaries become
active from the period of puberty, from which dates the commencing
aptitude for procreation, until the menopause, or
final cessation of the menses, which, in popular language, is
termed “change of life,” when the aptitude for conception
ceases with the proliferation of the ova.</p>

<p>The period of fruitfulness is characterized by the persistence
of the menses, and this terminates, on the average, in
the forty-fifth year; during all of this time the little ova, or
eggs, continually ripen, and at their maturity the ovisacs, or
Graafian vesicles, rupture from an increased secretion into
their cavities. This ripening of an egg and rupture of a
follicle corresponds with the monthly flow. The human
ovum is very small; the largest does not measure above
1-120th of an inch in diameter, and very often it measures
only half that size.</p>

<p>The situation of the ovary is not fixed in the pelvic
cavity with any absolute degree of certainty, but it enjoys
a degree of mobility that is even greater than that of the
womb itself, to which it is attached by means of the ovarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
ligament. Its usual place is about an inch from the uterus
and a little backwards. It is partly surrounded by folds
of peritoneum, and partly by the tissue that pads out the
interspaces between the pelvic organs. If we remember the
physiological fact, that at every monthly discharge of blood
from the uterus, which is called menstruation, an ovum or
egg ripens and an ovisac bursts, we cannot fail to appreciate
the importance of the intimate relations that these functions
must have, to the health of the individual and the perpetuation
of the species.</p>

<p>This process of ovulation has the peculiarity of the first
stages of an inflammatory action, because the ovaries become
congested whenever an ovisac ruptures.</p>

<p>Through the nervous sympathy existing between the
ovaries and uterus, this too becomes congested, so that the
network of uterine vessels becomes so engorged that the
capillary blood vessels of the mucous membrane of the
womb rupture, and the hemorrhage that is the result constitutes
the menstrual flow.</p>

<p>There are three physiological processes concerned in the
menstrual phenomena: first, irritation and congestion of the
ovary, rupturing the ovisac; second, congestion of the Fallopian
tubes and uterus; third, consequent rupture of the
blood vessels of the mucous membrane of the uterus and
probably of the Fallopian tubes.</p>

<p>There may be one or more supernumerary ovaries without
disturbing the normal functions; one or both ovaries
may be congenitally absent. The entire absence of both
ovaries is generally accompanied by deformities of so serious
a nature that the newly-born infant is incapable of living.</p>

<p>If the defect is principally limited to congenital absence
of the ovaries, then there is an absence of the changes in
which puberty is recognized; the mammary glands remain
flat; there is not the roundness and fullness of the girl’s
figure that signalizes budding maidenhood. The apparently
undeveloped form and girlish characteristics are prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
into the years of adult age, and she remains weakly and
small.</p>

<p>In an incomplete or rudimentary development, from an
arrested or imperfect evolution of the ovaries, there is often
a condition that resembles the above very much; neither are
these cases nearly so infrequent as those whose organs are
entirely absent. The ovaries may persist in their fetal
state, or their growth may be arrested at any time before the
expected period of puberty. The diagnosis of this pathological
condition must be inferred from the undeveloped
state of the different organs and from the absence of those
signs which the approach of the menses communicate.</p>

<p>Displacements of the ovaries are often the cause of suffering
and disease, that may excite symptoms quite remote
from the seat of trouble. I remember the case of a young
woman, who had suffered from obstinate dyspepsia, which
subsided at once after the removal of the prolapsed ovary.
It has been already alluded to, that these glands are naturally
very movable. Anything which increases their weight,
whether inflammatory enlargement or a dragging in connection
with some inflammatory adhesion to a neighboring
organ, may cause their displacement in various directions.
It happens that the ovary may form the contents of a
hernia or rupture. A prolapse or descent is the most common
form of an ovarian displacement. We often find one
or the other ovary resting in the pouch between the uterus
and rectum, and if the patient should be troubled with constipation,
the hardened feces may give rise to painful symptoms
in the ovaries, and pain in the rectum, while it also is
one of the causes of painful sexual relations. The irritation
to which the dislocated ovary is exposed gives rise to inflammatory
affections, that may be the cause of continual
suffering.</p>

<p class="psh">INFLAMMATION OF THE OVARIES, OR ACUTE OVARITIS.</p>

<p>What inflammation is elsewhere, it is again here in
these glandular structures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>I endeavored to point out in the beginning of these articles,
that the difference of inflammatory diseases was not
due to any difference in the inflammatory processes, these
are identical, but the modification of the processes are due
to the nature of the structure of the tissues that are involved.</p>

<p>If the intelligent reader will bear this in mind, she will
form a clear idea of all the inflammatory diseases that come
under consideration.</p>

<p>Pathological microscopists have recognized two forms of
<i>ovaritis</i>, the follicular or parenchymatous, in which the
Graafian follicles or ovisacs are the seat of the inflammatory
process, and the <i>interstitial</i>, in which the intervening or
interstitial connective tissue, the <i>stroma</i>, between the follicles
is inflamed. This distinction has only a scientific interest
because it is impossible to distinguish one variety from the
other in the living subject; this can only be done with the
aid of a powerful microscope after the suspected ovary is
removed from the body. Whether the inflammation is
follicular or interstitial or both combined, it is liable to destroy
all the follicles or ovisacs which contain the ova, that
are essential to procreation, and the consequence will be
sterility.</p>

<p>The great functional activity to which the ovaries are subjected
at each menstrual period, make them extremely liable
to an inflammatory process, so that women cannot be too
careful of themselves at this precarious period. It is during
menstruation that the ovaries become periodically congested,
and this alone offers an excellent predisposition for inflammation.
As a complication of other inflammatory diseases,
ovaritis is very common; it seems hardly probable that
there can be an inflammation of a pelvic peritoneal fold or
of the pelvic cellular tissue in close proximity to or surrounded
by it, without involving the corresponding ovary.
There cannot be a serious inflammation of the womb or of
the Fallopian tubes without being communicated to the
ovaries, and this is always true of the infectious catarrhs,
especially the gonorrhœal form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a great tendency in inflammation of the ovaries
to suppurate and change the entire tissue of the ovary into
an abscess. Ovarian abscesses are not much different in
their behavior from abscesses in the Fallopian tubes or
cellular tissue. It is claimed that they have a greater
tendency to break into the bladder than other pelvic
abscesses; this may be due to a displacement of the ovary,
which locates the gland near or between the bladder and
uterus, before the advent of the inflammation. There are
no infallible signs that point to the existence of acute inflammation
of the ovaries, owing to the complication of
other inflammatory processes in the majority of cases. The
characteristic pain of an inflamed ovary is of a throbbing
or pulsating nature.</p>

<p>I cannot imagine an ovaritis without at least a circumscribed
peritonitis, and one can hardly suppose a pelvic
peritonitis to exist without in a certain degree compromising
the ovary.</p>

<p>If the ovary has once become inflamed, whether alone
or as a complication of other diseases, then the most important
question to decide is the existence of an abscess.
This can only be recognized by an experienced and careful
specialist, who has trained his sense of touch, so that he
can feel the abscess between the fingers of one hand in the
vagina, and the other making counter pressure on the
abdomen. The history of each case must in a measure decide
the nature of the fluctuating tumor, whether it may
not be an ovarian cyst instead of an abscess, although an
abscess may have been a small cyst.</p>

<p>The development and course of different cases, present
various aspects for consideration. The enlargement may
become obstinate to the ordinary methods of treatment and
assume the chronic form of subacute inflammation. The
inflammation may spread from the ovary to the peritoneal
membrane that partly covers it; these are the broad ligaments
of the uterus. This may be the means through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
which the organ may grow to the surrounding tissue and
adjacent organs, so that it becomes utterly impossible to
move it or even successfully extirpate it from its intimate
attachments.</p>

<p>In other cases the ovary remains entirely free from attachments
or complications, and while it can be generally
felt lower down pressing perhaps on the rectum, it is readily
movable or replaced. In the majority of cases only one
ovary is involved, but in these cases there is a predisposition
which in a large proportion sooner or later compromises
also the other ovary in a similar diseased process.</p>

<p class="psh">TREATMENT.</p>

<p>The treatment of this affection is greatly modified or influenced
by a knowledge of the causation of the inflammation.
In every case, however, the patient should take to
her bed. If there is a profuse vaginal secretion it should
be ascertained if the disease is of infectious origin, and
where this is suspected, the vaginal canal should be thoroughly
rinsed with an antiseptic solution of corrosive chloride
of mercury in the proportion of one grain of the sublimate
to two thousand grains or parts of water, or about
fifteen grains to the half gallon of water. There are tablets
to be had at the drug stores which contain the requisite
amount of corrosive when added to a given quantity of water;
these are preferable and more convenient than the crude
drug, and as they are a <i>deadly poison</i> they should be kept
under lock and key. There is nothing to equal the corrosive
for an offensive vaginal discharge, for it is the most reliable
disinfectant there is in the entire pharmacopœa. Half
a gallon of this solution should be used at a time, and after
the vaginal canal has been thoroughly disinfected, about a
pint of the same solution must be passed through the uterine
cavity by means of a double catheter, that has a reverse
flow and is especially made for the purpose. To insure
against mercurial poisoning I am in the habit of following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
mercurial irrigations with warm water, that was previously
sterilized by boiling. One pint of the simple water is generally
sufficient to displace all the mercurial water that
might have remained in the uterine or vaginal cavities.
These medicated irrigations should have an average temperature
of 105 degrees Fahr. and be repeated daily for about
a week.</p>

<p>If the vaginal secretion is not of a specific nature, then
the Femina antiseptic uterine lotion is a safer remedy.</p>

<p>Ice bags applied over the regions of the painful ovaries
check the acute inflammation from going into suppuration
and forming an abscess. Should the latter be found to exist,
it should be opened by means of a trocar or aspirator. The
bowels should be kept free by taking a daily dose of Femina
laxative tablets.</p>

<p class="psh">CHRONIC OVARITIS.</p>

<p>If an acute inflammation does not terminate in prompt
recovery or an abscess it may lose its fiery nature and tone
down into a low grade of prolonged congestion which does
not go on to the production of suppuration. This would
constitute the chronic form of inflammation.</p>

<p>It does not follow that all chronic inflammations are preceded
by the acute form, for there are inflammations that
are subacute from the beginning, that is, that there is not
the heat nor feverishness in the tissues which is one of the
principal features of the acute process.</p>

<p>Chronic inflammation of the ovaries is much more frequent
as an original or individual affection, than the preceding
form. A peculiar feature of this affection is a gradual
growth or enlargement of the ovary, all the way from a
moderate swelling to a good-sized orange. There has been
some discussion as to the particular tissue of the ovaries
that is involved in the inflammatory process, whether it is
the interfollicular structure or the follicules or ovisacs themselves;
practically the solution of this question has no bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
on the treatment, although it may have an influence on
the function of the organ, which may be more injuriously
affected by the latter than the former variety. The disease
occurs almost exclusively after the age of puberty and during
the period of sexual activity. It is not as often met in
the unmarried as in the married, and with the latter it is
more prevalent in the first years of married life. Inordinate
sexual indulgence is a frequent exciting cause, and
when this is coupled with pernicious means that are employed
for preventing conception, it becomes still more frequent.</p>

<p>Chronic inflammation of the vagina, womb, and of the
Fallopian tubes is often transferred to the ovaries.</p>

<p>The infectious catarrh to which the genital tract of the
female is more or less exposed from a lack of proper cleanliness
of her own person, or a gonorrhœal infection from
her male companion, show a peculiar tendency to gradually
spread the inflammatory processes to the ovaries. Some
careful observation has established the fact that an apparently
cured gonorrhœal infection in the male may, after a
year or two, excite a gonorrhœal catarrh in the genitals of the
female; a great many diseases of the ovaries have been
traced to this source of infection.</p>

<p>As gonorrhœa is not an uncommon affection among the
male portion of the community, it is not sufficient for the
intelligent members of the medical profession to know of
these dangers of infection, but every man and woman should
be apprised of the great danger there is of infecting the
marital chamber with the pollution of the brothel.</p>

<p>The symptoms of chronic ovaritis are more or less dependent
on the causation of each individual case.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is traced to the fiery stage of the acute affection,
while in other instances it can be laid to some indiscretion
during the menstrual flow, then, again, it may have
developed itself so stealthily that the greatest acumen and
skill are required to detect its origin. The most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and constant sign is a steady pain in one or both ovaries.
When this pain is violent, it shoots toward the back and
rectum and down the thighs. The pain becomes heightened
from an accumulation of feces in the rectum, which a
habitual constipation entails. Marital excesses near the approach
of the menstrual period or shortly after the disappearance
of the menses are quite likely to precipitate the
painful symptoms. The bladder sympathizes in a certain
proportion of cases, so that there is a frequent desire to pass
water. In the course of time the distressful symptoms that
have been enumerated derange the digestive apparatus; the
patients lose their appetite and decline into a debilitated and
nervous state, so that one or the other hysterical phenomenon
become more or less prominent in persons of a nervous
temperament.</p>

<p>Sterility is a rule with this class of women, even if there
is only one ovary affected; this would indicate that the apparently
healthy one sympathizes with the other, or an accompanying
catarrh of the uterus or tubes may prevent the
passage of the fertilizing germ. If both ovaries are inflamed,
then it is quite natural to suppose that the delicate follicles
and their contents, the ova, become destroyed or so altered
that they no longer answer the purpose of reproduction.
It is seldom that one meets a chronic ovaritis without a
uterine catarrh, and how much this contributes to the sterility
is not easy to tell.</p>

<p class="psh">TREATMENT.</p>

<p>The course of this affection in the majority of cases is
favorable. If the treatment is intelligently administered,
the pain and congestion gradually subside, and as this class
of patients have generally learned from sad experience that
negligence or indiscretion on their part will excite a relapse,
they soon learn to avoid these, so that they enjoy comparative
immunity from suffering for a considerable length of
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a smaller proportion of cases whose unfortunate
surroundings or lack of intelligence makes remedial measures
of no avail. These poor women have neither respite
from physical labor nor freedom from the animal passions of
their husbands, and thus living in constant pain they become
drooped in spirit and reduced in vigor, so that they
fall an easy victim to any intercurrent affection that may
attack them.</p>

<p>In proportion as the patients can give their diseased
ovaries freedom from irritating influences are the chances
for their complete recovery increased.</p>

<p>To accomplish this object, quietude in the recumbent
posture, sexual abstinence and a free daily stool form the
basis for recovery. If there is much pelvic pain, this is best
controlled by means of the ice bag, 4x6 inches in size, of
which one on each side, wrapped in one thickness of flannel,
should be applied to the groin or region of the ovaries;
cold-water compresses, thoroughly wrung, so as not to drip,
and covered with flannel so as to keep the bed covering dry,
are also advisable, but only a poor substitute for the ice.</p>

<p>Iodoform suppositories greatly stimulate the absorption
of the inflammatory exudation; one of these should be introduced
into the vaginal canal each day. If the patient
can get up without any painful symptoms, she should take
the hot sitz bath for ten or fifteen minutes daily, and as a
general tonic, this is a useful prescription.</p>

<p>There is no affection in the entire category of diseases of
women, in which the confidence of women has been more
abused by specialists, than by meddlesome surgical invasions,
for the extirpation of one or both ovaries, to cure real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
or imaginary diseases of these glands. There is a veritable
mania among surgeons for this operation, but the conservative
portion of the profession are awakening to a conviction
that this is entirely wrong, and a presumption on professional
license that is altogether unpardonable.</p>

<p>If these castrations were confined to the removal of
ovaries that are unmistakably degenerated or diseased, and
that had resisted intelligent treatment for some time, there
would not be the same objection, but when ovaries are removed
that are apparently healthy, but through ignorance
or incompetency are supposed to be the offending members,
then, I say, that is an outrage.</p>

<p>There are a great many women who have been subjected
to the dangers of a so-called normal ovariotomy, without being
in the least benefited by the operation. The symptoms
which the extirpation of their ovaries was to relieve, persisted
as before, and they discovered, when it was too late,
that spaying is not a panacea for the ills that suffering
women are heir to.</p>

<p>The ovaries are in delicate sympathy with all the other
pelvic organs, and when these are affected there may be
more or less pain in one or both of these glands. They
may be even the seat of a neuralgic affection without any
structural change in the organ or in the neighboring organs.
This would be simply a reflex sign of a general debilitated
condition, and to mistake all these for ovarian
disease and to make it an excuse for their removal, is not
warranted by careful observation. Electricity is now coming
to the front as one of the most valuable remedies for
just this class of affections, and I will give a detailed account
of the nature of this remedy and the requirements for
its successful application, which persons who speak lightly
of its virtue, never acquire nor take the pains to possess.</p>

<p class="pch">PERIMETRITIS AND PELVIC PERITONITIS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> peritoneum is a delicate, thin, serous membrane,
that lines the whole internal surface of the abdomen and
envelopes more or less completely all the abdominal organs,
so that the viscera glide smoothly against each other with
the least possible friction. The peritoneum dips down almost
midway into the true pelvis, and its boundaries constitute
also the limit of the abdominal cavity. That portion
of the general peritoneum, which partly invests all the
pelvic organs, is distinguished from the other by the term
<i>pelvic peritoneum</i>. When the entire membrane becomes the
seat of inflammation, the affection is a general <i>peritonitis</i>,
but when the inflammation is limited to the organ that it
infolds, the prefix <i>peri</i>, signifying <i>around</i>, is compounded
with the name of the organ, and the suffix <i>itis</i> is added,
which indicates that the peritoneal covering of such an
organ is inflamed, hence, the term <i>peri-metra-itis</i> means
inflammation of the peritoneum around the womb.</p>

<p>Pelvic peritonitis means that the peritoneum of the entire
pelvic cavity is involved in the inflammatory process.
This may include the peritoneal covering of all the other
pelvic organs besides that of the womb as well as the peritoneal
folds, that enter into the formation of the broad and
other ligaments of the pelvic organs.</p>

<p>Perimetritis is rarely an independent uncomplicated disease,
but oftener a complication of inflammation of the
womb, the Fallopian tubes, ovaries, or of the cellular tissue
that surrounds the organs and in which they are imbedded.
The pelvic peritoneum and the cellular tissue are so intimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
connected with each other by means of their vessels,
nerves and lymphatics, that an inflammation easily
runs from one tissue to another.</p>

<p>If we now inquire into the causes which induce this disease,
we shall find that there is not a single inflammatory
disease of any of the pelvic organs that may not lead to its
inauguration. Metritis after an abortion or a confinement
is a fruitful source, so are all the other causes that operate
in exciting metritis indirectly concerned in this affection.
Since etiology or the causation of diseases has been made a
special study in connection with this subject, some startling
discoveries have been made in regard to the origin of pelvic
peritonitis.</p>

<p>Dr. Noeggerath, of New York, has found in the majority
of cases that came under his observation, that pelvic peritonitis,
either acute or chronic, is due to gonorrhœal infection.
He claims that gonorrhœa in the male is in the
majority of instances incurable; although it may be apparently
cured, it continues as a latent affection which regularly
infects his female companion. This shows itself at first as
a slight vaginal catarrh, which gradually and stealthily
spreads to the cavity of the womb, thence to the Fallopian
tubes and ovaries and afterwards involving the pelvic peritoneum,
for it must be remembered that the Fallopian tubes
open directly into the peritoneal cavity.</p>

<p>Dr. Noeggerath has collected statistics that agree with
those of the celebrated French physician, Ricord, which
show that on an average 80 per cent of the male population
have had gonorrhœa, and, believing themselves cured, when
not, enter into married relations, and unwittingly infect their
wives. He says that “it has come to pass that young ladies
dread to marry, because all their friends become invalids
soon after the nuptial rites.” The late Professor Schroeder,
of the Berlin Gynecological clinic, says that “the assertions
of Noeggerath are extravagant, but that he must particularly
emphasize that chronic inflammatory conditions of the internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
female genitals, like catarrh of the vagina and uterus,
metritis and perimetritis, are extraordinarily frequent results
of gonorrhœal infection.”</p>

<p>I am inclined to think, from my own experience, that the
more conservative view of Professor Schroeder is perfectly
safe and true, but if Dr. Noeggerath made due allowance for
the number of invalids among newly-married people whose
uterine diseases, especially pelvic peritonitis, were traceable to
criminal abortions and monthly probing of their uterine
cavities to induce the menstrual flow, his views would about
coincide with those of the distinguished Berlin authority.
These catarrhal affections cause sterility, and if conception
supervenes, then there is a likelihood of a miscarriage or a
premature birth, or a perimetritis during pregnancy or confinement.</p>

<p>Menstrual disorders in which the flow is either obstructed
or suppressed may also give rise to perimetritis.</p>

<p>Blood poisoning from criminal operations contributes its
share in the causation. Traumatic agencies, like blows, falls,
lacerations, and other injuries during labor, may result in
pelvic peritonitis.</p>

<p>Either too hot or too cold vaginal irrigations have given
rise to this affection, and injections into the cavity of the
womb for medicinal purposes, in which some of the fluid
escaped through the Fallopian tube into the peritoneal cavity,
has caused, in several instances, fatal peritonitis. The
inflammation of the womb after childbirth invariably involves
the peritoneum. The course and duration of this
disease is by no means uniform.</p>

<p>The disease under consideration is an example of an
acute inflammation affecting a serous membrane.</p>

<p>I have taken pains to inform the reader that the phenomena
of inflammation are always the same, but that the
results are modified by the peculiarity of the structure of
which the tissues are composed.</p>

<p>A serous membrane differs completely from a mucous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
membrane, inasmuch as it contains neither mucous glands
nor mucous cells, and for that reason can never be the seat
of catarrh; instead of this, it possesses the power to secrete
or transude the serous portion of the blood, hence its name.
The serous membrane in a healthy condition has only a
sufficient quantity of secretion to moisten the membrane,
but not to furnish any appreciable quantity of fluid. If the
secretion takes place as a result of congestion, especially
when this congestion is due to an obstruction to the return
of blood from heart or liver disease, it is secreted in such
large quantities that it constitutes dropsy.</p>

<p>Under the stimulating influence of the inflammatory
process, a similar secretion is the result, only that it contains
also <i>fibrin</i>, which renders the secretion or exudation spontaneously
coagulable, and, further, possesses the capability of
passing into the condition of an organized tissue, either
fibrous or granular, and thus forming false membranes on
inflamed surfaces, or solidifying into tumors or swellings.</p>

<p>These inflammations have their various degrees of severity,
from a temporary reddening of the membrane with
barely enough effusion of inflammatory material to cause a
thin layer of deposit, to extensive and violent attacks, that
pour out enormous quantities of effusion or exudation, so as
to fill the entire pelvic cavity with a solid mass. The nature
of the inflammatory material may be purulent from the
beginning, because its origin was of an infectious or septic
nature.</p>

<p>Suppuration may develop slowly and lead to an abscess;
this may open or break into the peritoneal cavity, causing
general septic peritonitis, which will cause death in a few
hours or days. The abscess may also suppurate and break
into some of the adjacent organs or tunnel its way in different
circuitous routes, being guided in its course by the
pelvic and muscular fasciæ, so that it may perforate at the
groin, show itself at the inside of the thighs, or in the lumbar
region near the kidneys. It ruptures most frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
into the rectum, next in frequency into the vagina and into
the bladder. I had a case, that came under my treatment,
in which both rectum and vagina were perforated, and purulent
matter discharged from both fistulæ; under appropriate
treatment the patient recovered completely.</p>

<p>If the inflammation is not of infectious origin, the exudation
gradually becomes absorbed, and each day grows less,
until finally nothing but a few fibrous bands can be felt, and
these too may disappear in time.</p>

<p>The symptoms of perimetritis depend in a great measure
on the nature and severity of the attack.</p>

<p>There are three distinct stages of this disease, and each
has its characteristic symptoms. The first stage is that of
inflammatory congestion, which is generally ushered in with
a distinct chill or a chilly feeling, which is speedily followed
by a high fever and a rapid pulse. The lower abdominal
region becomes exceedingly sensitive and very painful on
pressure; the abdomen becomes tympanitic or bloated, and
it is a relief for the patient to draw her limbs up, so as
to relax the abdominal walls. A vaginal examination in
this stage gives only negative results; there is nothing but a
painful sensitiveness, great heat, and the vaginal walls are
puffed or swollen; there is as yet no inflammatory exudation
that can be felt by the finger.</p>

<p>After the affection has lasted one or more days, the second
stage of the disease is recognized, this is the effusion or
exudation. The characteristic physical signs of effusion are
the only absolute proof of the existence of this disease.
These signs are (1st) an immovable fixed state of the womb,
which is quite the contrary to its natural healthy state, that
permits of a mobility in all directions; (2d) a hard, non-bulging
condition of the tissues that surround the womb, so
that the impression which one receives gives the idea of all
the pelvic organs being cast or set in wax, because everything
is glued down and immovable; (3d) an indistinct fullness is
felt by the patient, high up in the pelvis; this is the free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
exudation of the inflammatory material, which has now become
solidified and has some characteristics of a tumor.
This may push the organ forward or to either side or surround
the womb on all sides.</p>

<p>The third stage is that of absorption or the gradual disappearance
of the exudation; this is usually a slow process,
and may take from three to six months. I have known residues
of the exudation, in the form of fibrous bands or adhesions
or solid lumps to remain for years in the pelvic or
peritoneal cavity. These bands may tie or fix the uterus to
the rectum or to the pelvic walls, so that it will resist all ordinary
efforts to replace it. Pelvic hematocele, or an effusion
of blood into the pelvic peritoneum, inclosed either by anatomical
structures or previously-existing inflammations,
greatly resembles the sero-fibrinous exudation of perimetritis.
The pallor of the countenance aided by other signs of hemorrhage
must assist in distinguishing the affections.</p>

<p>Chronic perimetritis is developed in numerous affections
of the womb that exert a continuous irritation of its peritoneal
covering. These are fibroid and malignant tumors,
painful and difficult menstruation, as well as enlargement
of the tubes and ovaries. Inflammation of the uterus and
a discharge of blood or matter through the tubes and into
the peritoneal cavity, may bring about a chronic pelvic
peritonitis from the beginning.</p>

<p>Chronic perimetritis or chronic pelvic peritonitis, for the
terms are often interchangeable, is most abrupt in its development,
because it is not heralded by fiery, acute febrile
symptoms, but a close inquiry will usually recall to the
minds of patients the commencement of the trouble. The
fact that the peritoneum is also reflected on the bladder,
causes an irritability of this organ, to be the first and only
symptom, for quite a while. There is nothing stereotyped
in the development of any disease, so that the symptoms
may or may not be painful from the beginning. The pains
in the pelvis are more or less continual, there is an incapacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
for bodily exertion, the bowels are out of order, either there
is constipation or a chronic diarrhœa; these morbid conditions
destroy the appetite and the patient becomes lean and
weakly. From time to time all these abnormal signs become
aggravated, so that the sufferer may be forced to take
to her bed.</p>

<p>Some women have great powers of resistance and endure
suffering with great fortitude, so that they are comparatively
free from harassing pain, although their pelvic organs
are tied down by inflammatory adhesions, and unless they
lift or make other unusual muscular efforts, that increase
the intra-abdominal pressure, so as to drag on the adhesions,
they suffer little or no pain. Another sign of chronic perimetritis
is painful intercourse, which jars the adhesions,
and this is particularly the case if the womb comes down
quite low. The danger to be apprehended is that no one
knows at what moment some indiscretion will light up an
acute attack with all its serious consequences.</p>

<p>In view of the possibility of any local or circumscribed
peritonitis becoming general, and as such may prove fatal,
the importance of recognizing it in its first stage, or early,
becomes readily apparent.</p>

<p>Preventive measures of circumscribed or local peritonitis
are to be found in avoiding the causes that have been referred
to as inducing the affection under consideration, among
which, criminal abortions are the most fruitful. It seems to
me that if women were cognizant of the dangers that threaten
them, they would not only be more careful in observing the
ordinary rules of health, but they would voluntarily shrink
from committing crimes that not only stain their souls with
the blood of their own kindred, but also entail disease and
death, that unexpectedly waft their spirits into the presence
of their Creator, whose laws they have outraged. How
often have I been told by women who lay prostrated on
their death bed, “O doctor, I did not know that the induction
of an abortion was a crime and dangerous, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the person who performed the operation told me that it was
neither dangerous nor criminal.” Alas! poor woman, there
is no greater crime, and nothing more pernicious to your
health and life; would that others would only learn and profit
from the inexorable fate into which your delusions enticed
you.</p>

<p class="psh">TREATMENT.</p>

<p>The treatment in this affection, when prompt and intelligently
administered, offers every chance of success. In the
acute stage of pelvic peritonitis, we must resort to remedies
that promptly counteract the inflammatory action. The internal
administration of opium or some morphine preparation
is invariably demanded, not only to relieve the pain,
but also to completely check or constipate the bowels, so
that their peristaltic action is entirely suspended, for their
motion would irritate the peritoneum. Dr. McMunn’s
elixir of opium in one-half to one teaspoonful doses should
be given every four hours, until the pain is relieved and
the bowels controlled.</p>

<p>Rubber ice bags should be applied to the lower abdominal
region. This course of treatment will generally limit
and check the inflammatory process in a few days; then the
bowels should be gently moved every day, with an enema of
warm water impregnated with a little soap; after which,
complete quietude in bed for another week or two, will complete
the cure.</p>

<p>Chronic perimetritis must be treated according to its
complications; should there be a gonorrhœal infection, then
what was said of the treatment of this complaint elsewhere,
applies with equal force to these cases. The patient’s strength
must now be an object of jealous solicitude. The diet must
be of the most nourishing nature, and milk or egg punch
should be the principal food, at regular intervals of four
hours, alternating with strong soups or beef teas, to which a
raw egg thoroughly beaten should first be added.</p>

<p>Vaginal and uterine catarrhs, if they exist, require the
attention that is recommended in the preceding pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Warm compresses or fomentations and daily hot sitz
baths are of great value in chronic perimetritis, for they
stimulate the healing process and the absorption. The
bowels must now be daily moved, and here I prefer the
patient to employ simply warm water enema in tolerably
large quantities slowly injected, until a quart or more of
the fluid has been thrown into the rectum; these enemas will
not only move the bowels, but also stimulate the healing
process. If the patient lies on the left side while these injections
are taken or given, the enema flows higher up, and
it should be retained for a reasonable length of time.
These enemas should only be taken every other day, and
between days a suitable dose of purgative elixir. Tincture
of iodine can be applied to the groins every second day, or
iodoform suppositories introduced into the vagina. Mud
baths are also very beneficial in removing old inflammatory
adhesions.</p>

<p>If the exudation suppurates and an abscess forms, it
should be freely opened as soon as possible. This can generally
be best accomplished through the vagina, but if there
be a tendency of the abscess to point towards the groin, then
this situation would be preferable, although I prefer, in even
these cases, to make a counter opening in the vagina, for
this precludes the possibility of the abscess sacking or burrowing
further into the tissue. The cavity of the abscess
should be thoroughly rinsed out with a 2 per cent carbolic
acid or a 1 to 2,000 corrosive sublimate solution, and if there
is a tendency in the abscess to close before its cavity is healed
out, a rubber drainage tube should be inserted, so as to give
the pus all the possible facility to escape. If the abscess
breaks into the bladder or into the rectum, then a counter
opening into the vagina will greatly insure and expedite
recovery.</p>

<p>Sometimes the ovaries and tubes become diseased as a
result of the perimetritic inflammation; this, then, becomes
a subject of special inquiry and treatment. It should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
hardly be necessary to remind the reader that sexual relations
are to be suspended while there is the least sign of the
affection to be discerned. Although old adhesions and displacements,
the result of old chronic pelvic peritonitis, are
often naturally and permanently removed through a supervening
pregnancy, the intelligent use of the galvanic current
will also accomplish that end.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">PELVIC CELLULITIS OR PARAMETRITIS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> term <i>cellular</i> was given to this tissue, because under
the microscope it shows large meshes or cell-like cavities,
that are also termed areolæ, hence, the tissue is often called
areolar tissue; it is also called connective tissue, because it combines
all the different organs and structures of the body together.
It is very elastic and contractile, and by the fluid
which it contains in its areolæ, motion of parts on each
other is facilitated.</p>

<p>Professor Virchow has applied to it, in the region of the
womb or pelvis, the term <i>parametric</i> tissue, from the Greek
prefix <i>para</i>, beside, and the Latin <i>metra</i>, the womb, signifying
the tissue near and around the womb, from which the
Germans derive <i>parametritis</i>, instead of the English, who
employ <i>pelvic-cellulitis</i>, each meaning one and the same thing,
namely, inflammation of the cellular or connective tissue in
the pelvis or around the womb.</p>

<p>The female pelvic organs have interspaces between the
bladder, vagina and uterus in front, and the uterus, vagina
and rectum behind, also on both sides, between the womb,
ovaries, and the folds of the broad ligaments, and lastly, between
these organs and the walls of the pelvic cavity are
interspaces. These interspaces are filled in or padded out
by loose cellular tissue. M. Nonat, a celebrated French
authority, has described this in a beautiful figure, by saying
that “the organs of reproduction float in an atmosphere
of cellular tissue.” This is indeed so, and a consideration
of an inflammatory condition of this structure, is to conclude
the inquiry into the inflammatory diseases peculiar to
women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Pelvic cellulitis is one of those diseases for the comprehension
of which we are particularly indebted to the researches
of modern pathologists, who have discovered that
infectious germs are the cause of numerous diseases; pelvic
cellulitis is one of these, because it originates as a secondary
result of septic absorption.</p>

<p>The bacteria or putrefactive germs belong to Protophytes&mdash;the
smallest and simplest of all plants, some of them are
so small that it requires the highest powers of the microscope
to make them visible. Their growth and multiplication
have been experimentally demonstrated by artificial
cultivation, and this now constitutes one of the most interesting
studies of modern pathology.</p>

<p>Pasteur, Lister, Nægle and others, regard the decomposition
in the tissues as a direct result of the vegetation of the
bacteria. “Decomposition and fungus are inseparable; the
one ceases when the other is removed. Processes of this
nature set up by bacteria are best distinguished as <i>fermentations</i>.”
Professor Ziegler, of the University of Tuebingen,
says: “The healthy organism is always beset with a multitude
of <i>non-infectious bacteria</i>. They occupy the natural
cavities accessible from without, and especially the alimentary
canal. They feed on the substances lying in their
neighborhood, whether brought into the body or secreted by
the tissues. In so doing they set up chemical changes in
these tissues. While the organs are acting normally, these
fungi work no mischief to the tissues in which they lie, or to
the system generally. The products of decomposition set
up by such non-specific micro-organisms are either harmless
or are conveyed out of the body before they begin to be
active.</p>

<p>“Settlements of this kind may, however, become of importance,
if the bacteria proceed to develop to any unusual
extent. This happens when the contents of the natural
cavities in question remains unchanged for any great length
of time, or when (as in catarrh) the normal secretion undergoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
some alteration. The products of bacterial fermentation
may then accumulate to an excessive amount, and
products may be found which do not normally occur.
Highly poisonous substances are formed in many of the
bacterial decompositions. One of the most speedily fatal
diseases, septicæmia, is due to blood-poisoning of the system
with the products of bacterial putrefaction, or sepsis.</p>

<p>“Putrid or septic poison may be absorbed by wounds as
well as by mucous surfaces. Septicæmia, which has just
been cited as an instance of septic poisoning, is generally
due to wound infection. It is due to the absorption of products
of bacterial decomposition formed in a wound contaminated
by bacteria.</p>

<p>“<i>Infectious bacteria</i> have the power of settling, not merely
in the ingesta and secretions or in dead tissue, but also in
living tissue. This happens chiefly in the mucous membrane
of the lungs. The uninjured skin is protected against
invasion by the horny epidermis. Many bacteria can settle
in perfectly healthy mucous membrane. In the case of
others we must imagine that they do not find a proper soil
for their development, unless the mucous membrane is injured
or altered. Of course, injury or alteration of this
kind may serve to make the outer skin or any other accessible
tissue, the starting-point of a bacterial invasion (wound
infection). All that is necessary is that a bacterium should
reach a spot that affords the conditions for its development.
If this occurs, it multiplies and forms colonies or swarms.
These may, according to the species of the fungus and the
nature of the soil, remain in aggregation, forming heaps
or masses, or may spread through the tissues. In general
terms we may say that local settlements of bacteria will
sooner or later bring about degeneration and necrosis of the
affected tissue. When this may occur, and how widely it
may spread, are circumstances depending on the nature of
the bacteria and of the tissue.</p>

<p>“The inflammatory processes set up by bacterial action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
may be of very different intensity and extent in different
cases. It may be slight or transient, or may be severe and
issue in suppuration and an abscess.”</p>

<p>The above quotation is perhaps as concise and complete
an explanation as the space in this article will permit, and
if thoughtfully considered, it will be the means of understanding
what is to be said of the disease under consideration.</p>

<p>Pelvic cellulitis is oftener found in childbirth, premature
labor and abortion, for the reason that it is a wound infection,
and the female organism, is always more or less
wounded under these circumstances. In confinement the
cervix is always more or less torn, and septic matter deposited
there often speedily spreads along the lymphatics
and veins to the pelvic cellular tissue, in fact, the entire
uterine surface forms a suitable soil for bacterial growth.
The vagina is also more or less injured or bruised through
parturient efforts; this may be in the nature of a laceration
or an abrasion of its mucous surface.</p>

<p>Outside of the above causes, the infection may be of
traumatic origin, the most common causes being operative
measures on the vagina or womb of a cutting, scraping or
stitching nature, that were not carried out under strictly
antiseptic precautions, guaranteeing the exclusion of septic
germs. Dilation of the cervix with sponge tents or with instruments
or probes that were not perfectly cleansed, causes
infection and a decomposition of the retained secretions,
which, becoming absorbed, leads to pelvic cellulitis. In surgical
operations and puerperal conditions in which infection
has been positively excluded, by careful antiseptic measures,
pelvic cellulitis is impossible.</p>

<p>The inflammation in this disease is excited by the irritating
influences of products of septic decomposition; these
may have been introduced into the system at the time of
confinement or of an operation, or they may have been in the
vaginal tract before the operations were commenced. This
teaches an important lesson, which few seem to have learned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
it is this, that <i>the strictest antiseptic regulations in a confinement
or operation are of no avail, if the patient herself is not
first thoroughly disinfected before the operation begins</i>.</p>

<p>In the German Empire there is a legal provision giving
full instructions for the necessary disinfection of the lying-in
woman and her attendant; if there were such a wise provision
in this country, we would not hear of so many deaths
of women in childbed, from blood poisoning. At the Copenhagen
International Medical Congress (1884), Professor
Esmarch, one of the most celebrated of German surgeons,
said that “humanity demands antiseptic treatment of
wounds and wounded.” I believe that the time will soon
come that antiseptic regulations in the treatment of diseases
will not only be compulsory, but that a neglect of the same,
causing death by blood poisoning, will make the attendant
liable for exemplary damages.</p>

<p>Pelvic cellulitis generally develops itself in an acute
form, and the symptoms are very similar to those of pelvic
peritonitis, and, like the latter affection, there is always an
exudation of inflammatory material in these cases, so that
the meshes of the tissues become soaked like a sponge with
water. The invasion of the infection is usually signalized
by a distinct chill or rigors followed by an increased bodily
temperature and a correspondingly rapid pulse. The
commencement of a parametritis is not often without distinct
symptoms that affect the nervous system. The patient
feels uncomfortably depressed, a tired, worn-out feeling overcomes
her, she loses her appetite, and there is pain in the
pelvic cavity. This pain is partly due to an accompanying
peritoneal irritation, or in some cases to a circumscribed inflammation
of the peritoneum. Often the pain runs down
the groin, along the course of the great vessels and nerves;
this is occasioned from the exudation pressing on the trunks
of these structures in the pelvis. Pain in the small of the
back, and painful defecation, with an irritable bladder, are
due to the same cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Phlegmasia alba dolens, or what was called before the
dawn of modern pathological science, <i>milk leg</i>, is only another
form or a complication of pelvic cellulitis. This occurs
where the infectious inflammatory process runs along
the cellular or connective tissue of the large vessels and
nerves, to the connective tissue of the thighs; this is a very
easy matter, because the vessels and nerves are imbedded
in cellular tissue, and as the vessels leave the pelvis at the
groin, this tissue is continuous with that of the extremities.
When the inflammation gets into the thighs, it invades
either the subcutaneous cellular tissue, that is, the connective
tissue under the skin, or it runs along the trunks of the
nerves and vessels; the affected limb becomes then edematous
or swollen, hence the vague term of milk leg, because
the milk has never anything to do with it. One time it
was supposed that this affection is only possible after confinement,
but this is an error, because phlegmasia alba may
develop at any time from purulent infection, originating
from any cause.</p>

<p>The so-called puerperal or childbed fever is also nothing
more nor less than an infection of purulent secretion.</p>

<p>The extent of the exudation varies greatly, both in the
pelvis and in the limbs. In the pelvis it is sometimes only a
little swelling on each side of the womb, and between the
folds of the broad ligaments, small nodules the size of walnuts
can only be felt, while in other cases the entire pelvic
roof is covered and soaked with the inflammatory effusion.
The consistence of these swellings or tissues feels at first
doughy or soft, but after the absorption has been going on
for a while, it becomes as hard as a board. If the exudation
begins to suppurate and an abscess forms, then the surrounding
tissue becomes soft again, so that the fluctuation of an
elastic tumor becomes recognizable.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases the inflammatory process becomes
circumscribed in the pelvis, the fever subsides, and
the pain and sensitiveness in the pelvis disappear. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
exudation has also a circumscribed limit, becoming harder
and smaller, until it finally has become entirely absorbed.
In another class of cases, the swelling remains stationary
for a long time and a solid tumor remains in the pelvic
cavity, that may be mistaken for an ovarian or fibroid
growth, but in the course of a long time, it may gradually
become absorbed. In a certain proportion of cases the
course of the disease becomes protracted or chronic, because
the effusion is very slow to disappear. In these cases there
is danger of general septic infection or septicæmia, and of a
spreading of the cellular inflammation to the general peritoneal
membrane, which would prove, quite likely, fatal.
If the inflammation is violent and the infection intense,
suppuration and abscesses will destroy the cellular tissue,
and if the lower extremities become involved, the circulation
in the affected limb may become permanently injured.
The cellular tissue around the veins, or even the
veins themselves, become more or less affected by the inflammatory
process, so that the veins become compressed or
constricted from the cicatrization around them, or their caliber
may become obliterated from inflammation of the walls
of the veins, thus offering a permanent impediment to the
return of the blood to the heart; the affected limb now remains
swollen, and the swelling may entirely subside in the
recumbent posture at night, but during the day it returns
again, to make the leg thick and clumsy.</p>

<p class="psh">TREATMENT.</p>

<p>Prevention in these affections is much better than cure.
The treatment of a recent case of pelvic cellulitis must be
energetically antiseptic. The seat of the infection must be
discovered; the vagina or cavity of the uterus, as the case
may be, must be thoroughly washed out with a 1 to 2,000
corrosive sublimate solution. After a thorough disinfection,
the inflammation and pain can be checked or controlled
by the application of ice bags; this is the remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
<i>par excellence</i> to check acute inflammatory processes. These
bags are preferably of rubber, about 4x6 inches in size, and
when filled with ice and before applied it is more comfortable
to the patient to envelop the bag in a thin layer of
flannel, which takes off the clammy coldness. The patient
should be kept perfectly quiet and the bowels daily moved
by a mild purgative. After the sensitiveness and the fever
have subsided, the absorption of the hardened inflammatory
remnants is promoted by the daily employment of hot sitz
baths and the application of tincture of iodine to the inguinal
regions, as well as the use of iodoform suppositories.</p>

<p>The employment of blistering fluids or plasters is of no
particular value either to check the inflammation or promote
the absorption.</p>

<p>If there are symptoms of suppuration forming abscesses,
these should be freely opened into the vagina and their cavities
thoroughly rinsed out with a disinfecting solution.</p>

<p>In the case of phlegmasia dolens alba I have used cold
water compresses fortified by ice bags with brilliant results,
but only after all the other treatments that are laid down
in different treatises had been tried, and failed to give the
slightest relief. Among these were hot fomentations, large
repeated doses of morphine, and liniments of everything that
is usually prescribed to relieve pain; for the pain in phlegmasia
is sometimes excruciating.</p>

<p>My experience of the beneficial effects of ice bags and
cold-water compresses in the acute stages of pelvic cellulitis
and perimetritis, led me to believe that the same measures
would be useful when the cellulitis was in the cellular tissue
of the extremities, which constitutes phlegmasia dolens,
ignorantly termed milk leg. This appeared to be heroic
treatment to the patient, who dreaded the shock and feared
bad consequences, but she finally consented.</p>

<p>The following was my method: an ordinary large towel
was dipped into iced water, wrung out and clapped around
the affected limb, a heavy flannel roller bandage was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
applied from the toes upward to the groin; flannel is preferable,
because it does not get hard when moist and remains
softer under similar conditions than cotton material. On
the most painful parts, like the inner aspects of the thighs,
the back of the flexure of the knee, or popletial region, and
the calf of the leg, I laid rubber bags filled with ice in addition
to the cold-water compresses; these were kept in place
by a circular binder independent and outside of the roller
bandage.</p>

<p>The patient is naturally a little shocked when the cold
towel is first applied, but the unpleasantness is only momentary,
and then the reaction brings ease and comfort, so
that she desires the ice bags to be renewed quite often at
first, for the patient has now found a remedy that relieves
the pain as nothing else has ever done before. When the
towels become dry and hot, the painful symptoms return, so
that they should be dipped four to six times in the twenty-four
hours. If the sensitiveness on pressure and other indications
denote that the acute inflammatory process is
checked, then the compresses and ice may be discontinued.
This treatment avoids suppuration and the formation of abscesses,
while hot applications encourage them.</p>

<p>A mild stimulating diet of milk and egg punch with ten
to fifteen grains of quinine each day should be given in all
infectious inflammations.</p>

<p class="pch">ELECTRICITY AS A REMEDY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a brief reference to the medical virtues of electricity
in the treatment of diseases of women, only an outline of
its physics can be given, so as to give the reader an approximate
idea of its origin and phenomena.</p>

<p>The use that is being made of electricity in the arts has
convinced everybody that it is a most powerful agent, which
manifests itself in so many different phenomena that it is as
mysterious to-day as it was centuries before Christ, when
the Greeks first observed it in amber when rubbed with
silk, and from which the term has been derived.</p>

<p>Electricity is developed in bodies from a variety of
causes, among which are friction, pressure, chemical action,
heat, and magnetism. We are acquainted with it only
through the peculiarity of its action, and it behaves as a subtile,
imponderable fluid of a compound nature, possessing
opposite polarity when excited, giving rise to positive and
negative electricities, but when at rest these forces seem to
neutralize each other, and as such pervade all matter.</p>

<p>Chemical action is usually the most convenient for obtaining
electricity for medicinal purposes, and the arrangement
through which this is accomplished is called a cell or
battery.</p>

<p>A battery in its simplest construction is made of a plate
of zinc and a plate of copper partially immersed in dilute
sulphuric acid. A disturbance of the neutral electricity
now ensues, and by means of a delicate instrument, it may
be observed that the zinc plate possesses a feeble charge of
negative and the copper a feeble charge of positive electricity;
at the same time there is a slight escape of hydrogen
from the surface of the zinc. If now the plates are connected
by means of a metallic wire, the chemical action increases
and the hydrogen gas is now discharged from the
surface of the copper. The wire is now traversed by an
electric or voltaic current, which imparts to the connecting
wire, thermal, magnetic and other properties.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Apostoli’s method of employing intense galvanic currents
without discomfort or injury to the patient.</p>
       <p class="cap1">The internal electrode, which he calls the <i>excitateur intrauterin</i> is held in the hand
of the operator. The <i>dispersing</i> electrode covers the abdomen.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>The electricity does not, however, correspond to that
which was peculiar to the metallic plates before they were
connected by the wire, but the opposite electrical conditions
discharge themselves from the wire: the direction of the
current in the fluid, being from the positive or copper plate
to the zinc or negative plate, and vice versa, so that the wire
of the zinc plate is now positive, while that of the copper is
negative.</p>

<p>Poles and electrodes. The wires or terminals are called
the poles of the battery; instead of the term <i>poles</i>, the word
<i>electrode</i> is now generally used. From what was said of the
origin and direction of the current in the fluid, it is important
to remember that the positive electrode or wire is connected
to the negative plate, while the negative electrode is
connected with the positive plate.</p>

<p>According to the extent of surface of both zinc and copper
plates, exposed to the chemical action of the diluted sulphuric
acid, or to the number of cells that are employed, by
connecting the copper plate of one cell to the zinc plate of
the next, the force and quantity of the electric current is
correspondingly increased.</p>

<p>Batteries which consist of one solution and two metals
rapidly lose their intensity, partly from the decrease in the
chemical action owing to the neutralization of the sulphuric
acid by its combination with the zinc, and partly from secondary
currents, depositing a layer of hydrogen and metallic
zinc on the copper plate, which destroys the dissimilarity
of the metals, so that the electrical action ceases or the
plates become polarized.</p>

<p>For this reason these single fluid batteries have almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
entirely gone out of use, and batteries with two liquids have
taken their place.</p>

<p>Electrolysis means to dissolve or decompose, by means
of electricity, an organic or inorganic substance into its
original elements. If, for instance, a current of electricity
of four or five Bunsen’s cells is conducted to two inverted
glass tubes, filled with water slightly acidulated to increase
its conductivity, gas bubbles rise from the surface of each
pole, and upon examination it is found that hydrogen is
liberated at the negative pole and oxygen at the positive
pole; and as the volume of hydrogen liberated is about
twice that of oxygen, the experiment gives at once the qualitative
and quantitative analysis of water.</p>

<p>Professor Bartholow, in his treatise on Medical Electricity
says: “As animal tissues are composed of substances amenable
to electrolytic decomposition, it is obvious that they
must yield up their component elements in accordance with
the laws of electrolysis. Albumen is coagulated, salts are
separated into acids and bases, and water is resolved into
oxygen and hydrogen. When the salts contained in the
animal tissues&mdash;soda, potassa, lime&mdash;and water, are decomposed,
the acids and oxygen appear at the positive pole,
and the alkalies and hydrogen at the negative. It follows
that if the positive electrode be composed of metal, it will
be corroded by the action of chlorine and the acids, and the
negative will remain unacted on and smooth. The tissues
in the vicinity of each electrode are necessarily affected by
the elements brought to them in accordance with chemical
laws. About the positive the mineral acids and chlorine
form combinations, and hence do not attack the tissues with
the same energy as those about the negative pole. If, however,
the positive electrode is composed of zinc, for example,
the chlorine attacking it will form chloride of zinc, a very
corrosive material. This principle has been utilized to produce
caustic effects at the positive pole. Although the negative
electrode remains smooth, much more than at the positive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
are seen these destructive effects from the action of the
free alkali liberated in its neighborhood. When an ordinary
electrode of carbon covered with soft sponge is made
to conduct a strong galvanic current, the skin speedily becomes
reddened, and may be made to ulcerate if the contact
is sufficiently prolonged. If the carbon is applied directly,
an intense burning is produced and the tissues are destroyed,
leaving a slough, which is slowly detached and the ulcer remaining
is difficult to heal. The caustic action is due
chiefly to the soda, potash, and lime. Some effect must also
be allowed to the disassociation of the tissues, to their transference
from point to point and at the negative pole to the
mechanical action of the liberated hydrogen.”</p>

<p>Interpolar regions. The reader must have been impressed
with the peculiarity of each pole in possessing affinity
or attraction for certain elements that constitute the
animal tissue. Oxygen and acids accumulate around the
positive pole, while alkalies are attracted to the negative
pole; thus it must be an absolute fact that an actual transfer
of particles in both directions to each pole must traverse
the tissue lying between the two poles; this accounts in a
great measure for the difference of the local effect on the
tissues around the poles, one being in the nature of an acid
the other of a caustic alkali. This naturally gave rise to an
inquiry as to the effect that the galvanic current has on the
structure between the two poles.</p>

<p>Dr. G. Betton Massey, author of “Electricity in the Diseases
of Women,” asks and answers this question in the following
manner: “What can be therapeutically accomplished
when the seat of the disease is necessarily situated beyond
the direct reach of the electrode? An answer drawn from
both neurological and gynecological experience is that much
can be accomplished; and this is doubtless due, in the first
place, to the influence upon nutrition of the chemical
changes that occur throughout the circuit, in the onward
progress of the particles that appear free finally at the poles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to the influence upon nutrition of the circulatory changes
that result from vasomotor stimulation, and to the contractions
produced in unstriated muscular tissue by heavy currents
even at a distance. These results of quiet current
transmission are governed in magnitude at a given spot
by the <i>density</i> of the current at the situation and by the <i>duration</i>
of the application. To accomplish much in the more
distant parts of this region considerable strength must be
employed, hence a delicate judgment is demanded in the selection
of the size of the active pole to avoid cauterization
on the one hand, and too great a diffusion on the other.”</p>

<p>To within a comparatively recent period, the methods
of applying the electric current for the removal of abnormal
growths have been somewhat crude if not dangerous. It
appears that formerly altogether too much stress or weight
was laid on the chemical or electrolytic effects that the electrodes
wrought in the tissues, and very little or no credit
was given to the <i>passive</i> current of galvanism as it traversed
the tissues from pole to pole. Dr. Ephraim Cutter, of New
York, advocated the so-called electro-puncture, and in the
galvanic treatment of fibroid tumors of the uterus, these
punctures were made through the abdominal walls. The
electrodes for this purpose were stiletto shaped, with blades
five inches long and three-eighths of an inch at their widest
part; these were inserted into the tumor from opposite points.
Wounds that were thus inflicted, necessarily involved more
or less danger, and, although Dr. Cutter reported a great
number of cures, the percentage of mishaps was too great to
make electrical treatment popular among the profession.</p>

<p>It was not until Apostoli, a French physician, greatly
modified the methods of employing electricity in the treatment
of fibroid tumors, and sheared it in a great measure,
not only of its dangers, but also of pain, that the medical
profession took the question of electrical treatment in real
earnest. The practice of Apostoli and his results were published
in a monograph by Carlet, entitled, <i>Du traitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
electrique des tumeurs fibreuses de l’uterus, Paris, 1884</i>. Apostoli
evidently started out with a view to modify the most
objectionable features of the electrical treatment. This consisted
in reducing the number and size of the punctures
and to lessen the painful sensation of the electric current to
its minimum, so that the main points of difference are the
shape and size of electrodes, and the site that is chosen for
the puncture. In the first place he uses only one piercing
or needle electrode, which is much smaller than that of
Cutter, this may be attached to either the positive or negative
cord of the battery, according to the accompanying
symptoms. When hemorrhage is a symptom, the positive
pole is used internally or carries the needle on account of
its anti-hemorrhagic property, otherwise the negative pole
carries the piercing electrode. This electrode is always
used internally to puncture through the vagina or through
the cervical tissue into the tumor; this is not nearly so
painful as piercing the abdominal walls, nor does it wound
the peritoneum.</p>

<p>The other electrode is called the <i>dispersing</i> electrode, because
its purpose is to so disperse or scatter the current of
this pole that it is hardly felt by the patient, much less
produces any electrolytic or chemical effect on the skin.
This electrode is made from a sheet of lead or copper nine
by ten inches and covered with a layer of wet absorbent cotton;
it is applied over the abdomen. This method is much
safer than that formerly advocated by Dr. Cutter, and the
results are much better. Dr. Engelman, who has accepted
this method, says: “In electrolysis an intensity of 50 to 250
milliampères may be used for from three to eight minutes.
All possible precautions must be taken in the first sitting in
order to discover any idiosyncrasy of the patient, and a current
of 50 milliampères will suffice, attained by slow increase.
The patient should lie down quietly for several
hours after the application. If an intensity as high as 100
milliampères is used at the first sitting, it is preferable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
she remain in bed for the first twenty-four hours, and that a
cold compress or an ice bag be placed upon the abdomen,
to overcome any tendency to inflammatory reaction which
may occur; hence the attention to details which is necessary,
and the precautions desirable in a first puncture, until the
sufferance of the individual patient is tested. The application
is repeated, according to the demands of the case and
the severity of the treatment, once or twice a week.”</p>

<p>The milliampere meter is a galvanometer to measure the
quantity of electricity that is applied, and as a chemical battery
will of necessity change, a meter is the only means of
judging the intensity of the current; so that without one
there is danger of applying the current too strong, or an injustice
may be done to the patient, and reproach cast on the
treatment by not using it strong enough.</p>

<p>At the annual meeting of the American Medical Association,
at Chicago, in 1887, Dr. Martin read a paper, in which
he reported three cases that were treated with the most satisfactory
results without puncture. The positive or external
electrode was applied over the abdomen after the manner of
Apostoli, and the negative electrode was placed in the rectum,
vagina or uterus, in such a way as to cause the current
to traverse the largest diameter of the tumor; this
method is to my mind the <i>ideal</i> of an electrical treatment,
it is galvanism without corrosion or electrolysis.</p>

<p>The number of eminent authorities that I have quoted,
can hardly fail to convince the reader that electrical therapeutics
in the treatment of fibroid tumors are not only efficacious,
but in the infancy of experimental growth, so that
every day will add new proofs and improved methods to the
history of this most interesting subject. But this treatment
is not limited in its usefulness to the removal of abnormal
growths, for it has proven itself equally as effectual in the
treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions of the pelvic
organs. I have myself attained great success in curing
certain forms of these diseases since the publication of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
“A New Treatment of Chronic Metritis,” by the same indefatigable
author, Georges Apostoli, of Paris.</p>

<p>The value of electricity is now so firmly established that
a physician who, ignorant of its virtues, and laboring under
this self-imposed ignorance, brushes aside any reference to
or desire for electrical treatment with a supercilious air,
claiming “that there is nothing in it,” advertises himself as
incompetent or insincere.</p>

<p>It must be apparent to anyone who has followed this
brief outline from the beginning, that this subject requires
a special and individual devotion, so as to become familiar,
not only with the elementary principles of the physics of
electricity, but with the <i>technique</i> of applying the treatment
in each individual case. This, few persons have the honesty
or ambition to acquire, and if they own a battery, it is more
for show than for use. I am convinced that there are great
possibilities in store for the curative value of the galvanic
current, but it also requires a high order of intelligence to
employ it, in order that those hopes may be realized.</p>

<p>“<i>The positive pole</i> is anodyne, sedative, anti-congestive,
and anti-hemorrhagic. It combats and prevents the tendency
to excessive vascularization, and consequently relieves
congestion and inflammation and the pain depending upon
these conditions. Its local or polar action, when used within
the uterus, is hemostatic or styptic, and caustic, with high
intensities of current.</p>

<p>“<i>The negative pole</i> is stimulating and has a marked electrolytic
action. It tends to produce congestion, and a derivative
effect which favors absorption of tumors, inflammatory
deposits and adhesions. But great care must be observed in
using it in some conditions, lest a new inflammation be rekindled.”</p>

<p>I have the record of a case where the womb was retroflexed
and tied down by old inflammatory adhesions for
nine years; the retroflexion dated back to a miscarriage.
This woman had been an invalid since that time; her appetite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
was poor, and her digestion poorer, she was excessively
constipated, suffered from pain during menstruation, but at
other times there was a constant pain in the small of her
back, which ran down the right thigh, the bladder was irritable,
and there were neuralgic pains shooting from the
ovaries down the groins. All these symptoms became more
or less aggravated every few weeks or months. The womb
was so firmly fixed or glued down on the lower portion of
the spine, that it could not be moved an iota. This woman
had tried all the remedies that I could suggest, except galvanism.
This I concluded to try, by placing a large dispersing
electrode on the small of her back, and the other
electrode, properly prepared, so that it did not burn or cauterize,
was introduced into the vagina, against the posterior
aspect of the uterus. A current strength of from 90 to
120 milliampères was applied every other day for ten minutes;
in six weeks the organ was quite movable, and in five
months all adhesions had melted away, and the womb occupied
its normal position, and the patient was in every way
restored to health.</p>

<p>The diseases that are curable by galvanism are the different
forms of subacute or chronic inflammation of the ovaries,
and the consequent enlargement of these organs, small cysts
or fibro-cysts of the ovaries are also amenable to the galvanic
puncture.</p>

<p>Catarrhal inflammation of the Fallopian tubes, or when
either or both ends are agglutinated with inflammatory exudation,
so as to pen up their contents, which may be mucous,
water, pus or blood, these fluids should be first aspirated or
drawn off, and then, by means of appropriate galvanism, the
normal conditions of the tubes may be restored.</p>

<p>Chronic catarrhs of the womb are especially suited for
galvanic treatment, and when the inflammation invades the
muscular structure of the uterus, giving rise to what was
described as chronic metritis, there is no remedy that will
yield the same positive and satisfactory result as electricity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Plate V gives a practical illustration of the employment
of electricity for chronic inflammation of the uterus; the internal
or negative pole is introduced into the uterine cavity
and held there by the operator, the external or dispersing
pole spreads over and rests on the abdomen.</p>

<p>Subinvolution of the uterus. I have already referred
to this affection as an arrested involution of the womb after
confinement at the end of the natural term, and after abortion.
The womb in this condition remains permanently and
preternaturally enlarged, and its entire tissue becomes the
seat of a subacute or chronic inflammatory process. The
vagina is also more or less relaxed, so that the heavy uterus
sinks down into the pelvis, imparting to the patient a dragging
or bearing-down sensation, which makes walking or
any other exertion exceedingly difficult. In subinvolution
an extra uterine electrode is not required, but only a vaginal
electrode, so employed that a current of high intensity is
passed through the uterus; this varies from 50 to 150 milliampères.
The duration of each galvanization is from eight
to ten minutes, and should be repeated every third or sixth
day. I succeed as a rule in six to eight weeks in restoring
the organ to its normal size, which I ascertain through comparative
measurement at the beginning and end of the
treatment.</p>

<p>If the subinvolution is complicated with <i>retroflexion</i>, then
intra-uterine galvanization after the organ is replaced is
the most effective treatment. Old pelvic adhesions and exudations
as a result of pelvic cellulitis or peritonitis are
amenable to galvanization after hot douches, sitz baths, and
other discussives have failed to excite absorption.</p>

<p>Hemorrhoids and prolapse of the rectum; the former is
a frequent concomitant of constipation, and the latter may
be the result of an imperfect involution after confinement.
I have employed galvanism for either with the most brilliant
results.</p>

<p>It would be interesting for the reader were I to continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
to cite different diseases in which electricity has been successfully
employed, but that would require a systematic
arrangement of the subject, which would be incompatible
with the original purpose of this book. I simply desire to
awaken an interest in a comparatively new remedial agent,
in its present field of employment. There may be a great
many ways to get relief, but that course which offers the
least risk to <i>life</i> and the least suffering to the <i>living</i> is the
one that should recommend itself to the sufferer. What
patients need is not brilliant surgical exploits to make the
reputation of an ambitious operator, but the conscientious
aid of the conservative physician who is content to labor in
the less pretentious capacity of an assistant to nature’s curative
energy.</p>

<p class="pch">SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF PREGNANCY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pregnancy</span> is the condition in which the female has
within her an impregnated, <i>fecundated</i> germ, which gradually
becomes developed in or out of the womb. In a perfectly
normal state of things, the impregnated ovum becomes
attached to the inner surface of the womb by virtue of a
preordained vital force by which the ovum becomes animated
at the moment of conception. It obtains its nutrition from
a plexus of blood vessels, by means of which the ovum is
attached to the inner side of the walls of the uterus, and
this complex of vessels grows with the development of the
fetus, and constitutes the <i>placenta</i>, which, together with the
membranes and the umbilical cord, is called the afterbirth.</p>

<p>The growth of the embryo, which is the predestined
child in the mother’s womb, occupies a period of ten lunar
months, or two hundred and eighty days&mdash;this is the average
term of pregnancy, although the duration of pregnancy
is prolonged in a large proportion of cases to three hundred
days, and even longer, while in a small proportion of pregnant
women the period of gestation falls naturally shorter
than two hundred and eighty days.</p>

<p>In a small number of pregnancies the impregnated ovum
is arrested at the ovary, or on its passage from the latter
through the Fallopian tubes; it then does not arrive in the
cavity of the uterus. This state of things is unnatural,
hence termed <i>preternatural</i>, because the growth of the fetus
takes place out of the uterus, and this is also called <i>extrauterine</i>
pregnancy, which may take place in the ovary, Fallopian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
tubes, or cavity of the abdomen. False pregnancy implies
that there was no pregnancy at all, or in other words, that
there was no fetus, and that the enlargement was due to
something else.</p>

<p>In pregnancy the female experiences signs and symptoms
resulting from changes in the condition of her organs
and functions. The suppression of the courses or menstrual
discharges is considered in the popular mind an unerring
proof of pregnancy, yet, as a matter of fact, this is far from
the truth. I have known of two women who menstruated
regularly during the entire period of their pregnancies, and
there are a number of reliable cases recorded of women who
menstruated during pregnancy and at no other time.</p>

<p>It is a rule, that the menses cease during pregnancy, but
it is equally certain that the menstrual function becomes
suspended from other causes, and these are quite numerous,
so that taken by itself, the sign is of little importance.
Young married women not infrequently have a slight menstruation
for two or three periods after their first conception,
and on the other hand, newly married women will have their
menses occasionally arrested, and this may continue for two
or three months and indeed no pregnancy exist.</p>

<p>Nausea and vomiting is also presumptive evidence of
gestation. Some women are affected with sick stomach
almost from the moment of conception, and from actual
experience they are so certain of their condition, that they
can calculate with certainty the day of their confinement
from the time when they had their first feeling of nausea.
Experience seems to teach that a certain amount of nausea,
<i>the morning sickness</i>, and the vomiting which accompanies or
follows it, is to be met in women who go through a natural
or healthy pregnancy, so that many eminent authorities
have looked upon this symptom as a physiological accompaniment,
and one of the most constant and reliable symptoms.
The vomiting and nausea of pregnancy is different from that
which is an indication of general ill health; in pregnancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the vomiting is followed with a sense of relief, and the
patient is for the time being quite easy. The length of time
that women feel this gastric irritability varies in different
individuals; ordinarily it will cease about the fourth month,
sometimes sooner, and it may return again during the last
two or three months of gestation. It is supposed to be due
to a reflex action of the spinal cord from the uterus to the
stomach. It must be remembered, however, that a disease
of the uterus, a fibroid or ovarian tumor, and a suppression
of the menses from other causes than pregnancy will occasion
nausea and vomiting.</p>

<p>A capricious appetite is another of the peculiarities of
pregnancy, a longing for unnatural food, so that some
women will enjoy eating such things as chalk, slate pencils, and
similar indigestible stuff; this I have always considered a form
of hysteria, that is, a functional derangement of the nervous
system, for which I gave ten grains of bromide of sodium
three times a day, with the best results; others again became
passionately fond of sour salads, or strong condiments like
mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and salt fish, while others
again long for fruits.</p>

<p>Salivation of the mouth is another very unpleasant
symptom which annoys some women when they are pregnant,
for they will secrete such enormous quantities of saliva,
that they cannot help drooling from the mouth when they
speak. In salivation of pregnancy the gums do not become
sore as in the salivation from mercury; in the former the
irritation is confined to the salivary glands alone. The
wonderful sympathy that exists between remotely situated
organs of the body is here strikingly illustrated between the
sexual organs and the salivary glands in both sexes. In
mumps also, which is an inflammation of the salivary gland,
it is not unusual for the testes in the male and the mammæ
in the female to become swollen and painful, and as soon as
this swelling takes place, the inflammation of the salivary
gland disappears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>The breasts become enlarged and otherwise altered in
pregnancy, the enlargement is accompanied with more or
less sharply shooting pain, they also become harder and are
more movable than otherwise. The nipple becomes more
prominent and painfully sensitive, the veins that run from
the breast become distended so that they can be readily
traced by the eye. The presence of milk in the mammæ is
another sign, but that, too, is only presumptive, because the
secretion of milk takes place in other conditions than that
of pregnancy; even the newly-born infant has sometimes
milk in its breasts, and milk has been recognized in the
breasts of some males and not infrequently in those of young
virgins.</p>

<p>Pigmentation or the deposit of coloring matter in pregnancy
has long been observed as a prominent symptom and
when taken together with other signs it is worthy of careful
consideration, but here, too, we encounter the obstacle to anything
of a positive nature, for discoloration is also met with
in females who are suffering from pelvic diseases and who
are not pregnant. Areola is the technical name of that
peculiar circle which immediately surrounds the nipple.
In a healthy virgin this circle is characterized by a beautiful
rose-tinted blush, but under the influence of disease, even in
the virgin the circle becomes more or less discolored. When
pregnancy has occurred the areola around the nipple becomes
darker and darker; other parts of the body become similarly
discolored, this occurs on the abdomen and perineum.</p>

<p>The womb descends during the first two months of pregnancy,
this constitutes a kind of physiological falling of the
womb and indeed the accompanying symptoms of a pregnant
woman are often similar or identical to that diseased
and permanent condition of physical suffering, namely, falling
of the womb. Perhaps the most common symptoms of
the descent of the uterus will be more or less frequent desire
to pass water, because of the dragging of the womb on the
neck of the bladder; sometimes there is also a straining or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
inclination to go to stool, owing to pressure on the rectum
from the same cause.</p>

<p>The umbilicus or navel becomes painful and even depressed
from traction of the superior ligament of the bladder,
which is attached to the umbilicus, thus illustrating the
operation of cause and effect, namely, as the bladder is depressed
by the descended uterus, the bladder in turn pulls
on the umbilicus to which its ligament is attached. The
pregnant uterus remains only the first few months in this
depressed state; at the third month, as a result of its continual
growth and that of the fetus, the uterus ascends out of the
pelvis and as a natural consequence the symptoms of the
bladder and rectum subside. Towards the end of the ninth
month the womb again descends into the pelvis and with
this there may be a return of the irritation of the bladder
and a feeling of bearing down or tenesmus of the rectum.
The descent of the uterus toward the close of pregnancy
diminishes the prominence of the abdomen, and as the
diaphragm has freer play, the respiration becomes easier; if
there was any cough that, too, disappears, and on the whole
the woman feels herself more comfortable and in happy
spirits. This may even arouse suspicion in her own mind
as to her condition, because she does not know the cause of
the change; it may portend to her that something is not
right, that she is not pregnant or that her child may be
dead. In women who have borne one or more children in
a natural manner, the descent of the womb is of no particular
moment in the last months of gestation, because the
abdominal walls having been stretched by previous pregnancies
the body or fundus of the womb may fall forward
and give the lungs and other organs relief from pressure,
but in the first pregnancy this is never the case, because the
abdominal walls are too tense to allow this normal anteversion.</p>

<p>The German school of midwifery has laid down an important
rule as a consequence of this observation, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
never known an exception to occur in my experience. The
rule is that when the uterus does not descend into the pelvis
toward the close of the first pregnancy, it is because there is
a disproportion between the child’s head and the maternal
pelvis, or in other words that either the child’s head is too
large for a natural or unaided delivery to take place, or that
the pelvis of the mother is too small for a natural delivery
to take place, and this is true, and knowing this to be true
at the outset or commencement of a confinement it would
be only torture and a valuable loss of time to wait at the
bedside of a woman suffering with the pangs of childbirth
in the vain hope that she might deliver herself&mdash;when in
truth and as a fact that cannot be done without the aid of
scientific assistance.</p>

<p>The vagina and external organs are more or less modified
in pregnancy. The vagina becomes wider and shorter
and as there is an increase of spongy tissue, it presents a
swollen appearance. The mucous glands become larger and
secrete a greater abundance of mucus. The internal surface
of the vagina becomes discolored in consequence of pregnancy
and I believe that it is one of the most reliable presumptive
signs; the mucous membrane presents a sort of
bluish tint, a French authority calls it a violet hue, not
unlike the lees of wine.</p>

<p>Quickening is a term that is employed to designate the
particular length of time that pregnancy has existed, and at
the same time to furnish evidence to the mother through the
movements of the fetus that she carries within her womb a
living being. In a former chapter I have already detailed
the theory of the ancients upon this subject, which was as
absurd as it was fanciful. The late Professor Bedford defines
“quickening as nothing more than the ordinary result of
progressive increase when the physical organization of the
fetus has reached a state of development which imbues it
with the power of movement&mdash;a movement dependent upon
muscular contraction.” The period of quickening is usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
about the fourth and a half month or the middle term of
pregnancy.</p>

<p>Pulsation of the fetal heart, when heard, is no longer
presumptive but absolutely positive evidence that pregnancy
exists. That the heart of the child can be distinctly heard
to beat in its mother’s womb was one of the greatest discoveries
in midwifery. The pulsations of the fetal heart are
much faster than those of the mother’s heart, hence there is
no danger of getting them mixed; while the child’s heart
averages from one hundred and ten to one hundred and
sixty per minute, the heart of the mother averages from
seventy-five to eighty beats. There are cases where the
mystery of a pregnancy can be solved beyond a possibility
of a doubt, through the recognition of the pulsations of the
fetal heart, and yet a woman may be pregnant in whom it
will be impossible to distinguish the action of the child’s
heart, at the termination of her period of gestation she will
bring forth a healthy child.</p>

<p>The question whether a female is pregnant will, from the
very nature of the symptoms always remain debatable in a
certain proportion of cases, or, in other words, there is no
sign or symptom that is reliable and if reliable it is not uniformly
present. From a medico-legal standpoint the question
will always be of great importance, as it frequently
involves the guilt or innocence of the accused; the social
standing of one, or the merited punishment of the other, and
it does seem like a travesty on both science and justice that
at certain stages and in certain conditions no signs or symptoms
are absolutely reliable. The unfortunate creatures
whose illness may imitate or simulate the symptoms of pregnancy
must always receive the benefit of the doubt, this
would avoid the possibility of wrecking innocent lives. Professor
Bedford reports a case in his work on obstetrics which
is as sad as it is instructive, he says: “I was requested to
visit a lady who was residing in the State of New Jersey,
about thirty miles distant from New York. On my arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
I was received by her father, a venerable and accomplished
gentleman. He seemed broken in spirit, and it was evident
that grief had taken a deep hold of his frame. On being
introduced into his daughter’s room, my sympathies were at
once awakened in beholding the wreck of beauty which was
presented to my view. My presence did not seem to occasion
the slightest disturbance; she greeted me with these words:
‘Well, doctor, I am glad to see you on my beloved father’s
account, for he will not believe that I cannot yet be restored
to health. Life, however, has lost all its charms for me, and
I impatiently long for the repose of the grave.’ These words
were spoken with extraordinary gentleness, but yet with an
emphasis which at once gave me an insight into the character
of this lovely woman.</p>

<p>“Her father was a clergyman of high standing in the
English Church, and had a pastoral charge in England, in
which he continued until circumstances rendered it necessary
for him to leave that country, and seek a residence in
America. At a very early age, this young lady had lost her
mother, and had almost been entirely educated by her
father, whose talents, attainments, and moral excellence admirably
fitted him for this important duty. When she had
attained her eighteenth year, an attachment was formed between
her and a young barrister of great promise and respectability.
This attachment soon resulted in a matrimonial
engagement. Shortly after the engagement she began unaccountably
to decline in health; there was a manifest change
in her habits; she was no longer fond of society; its pleasures
ceased to allure and prove attractive; the friends whom
she had caressed with all the warmth of a sister’s love, now
became objects of indifference; in a word she was a changed
being&mdash;her personal appearance exhibited alterations evident
to the most superficial observer; her abdomen enlarged, the
breasts fuller than usual, the face pale and careworn, and
the appetite capricious, with much gastric derangement.
Many were the efforts made to account for this change in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the conduct and appearance of the young lady in question.
Speculation was at work, and numerous were the surmises
of her friends. The rumor soon spread that she was the
victim of seduction, and her altered appearance the result of
pregnancy.</p>

<p>“The barrister to whom she was affianced heard of these
reports, and instead of being the first to stand forth as her
protector, and draw nearer to his heart this lovely and injured
girl thus measurably assuaging the intensity of grief with
which she was overwhelmed, addressed a letter to her father
requesting to be released from his engagement. This was,
of course, assented to without hesitation. The daughter,
conscious of her own innocence, knowing better than anyone
else, her own immaculate character, and relying on
heaven to guide her in this her hour of tribulation, requested
that a physician should be sent for, in order that the nature
of her case might be clearly ascertained. A medical man
visited her, and after an investigation of her symptoms, informed
the father that she was undoubtedly pregnant, and
suggested that means should be taken to keep the unpleasant
matter secret. The father, indignant at this cruel imputation
against the honor of his child, requested an
additional consultation. This resulted (as usual) in a confirmation
of the opinion previously expressed, and the feelings
of that parent can be better appreciated than portrayed.</p>

<p>“That good man resigned his pastoral living to proceed
with his daughter to America. On her passage to this
country, the daughter became extremely ill, and the advice
of the physician on board the vessel was requested; he too
told the father that there was danger of premature delivery,
for he simply took appearances as his guide, and at once
concluded that she was pregnant.</p>

<p>“This is about the substance of what I learned of this
interesting and extraordinary woman. I proceeded with
great caution in the investigation of her case, and after a
faithful and critical survey, most minutely made in reference
to every point, I stated in broad and unequivocal language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
that she was not pregnant. The only reply the gentle creature
made on hearing my opinion, was&mdash;‘Doctor, you are
right.’ The father was soon made acquainted with the result
of my examination, but he indicated not the slightest
emotion. He asked me whether something could not be done
to restore her to health, and I thought that the old man’s
heart would break when I told him that his daughter was
in the last stages of consumption.</p>

<p>“It was the misfortune of this young lady to labor under
an affection of the womb, which simulated, in several important
particulars, the condition of pregnancy, and which
the world in its ignorance and undying thirst for scandal,
might have readily supposed did in fact exist; yet, there
was no excuse for the physician, guided as he should have
been by the lights of science, and governed by the principles
of sound morality. The result of my investigation impressed
me with the conviction beyond any shade of doubt, that
the entire train of symptoms indicating pregnancy was due
to the presence of a large <i>fibrous tumor</i> occupying the
cavity of the uterus. About four weeks from this time I
received a note announcing her death and asking that I
would hasten to the house for the purpose of an examination.
Dr. Ostrom, now practicing in Goshen, assisted me in
the autopsy. As the father stood before me he was not unlike
the stricken oak in the forest, which, though stripped
of its branches, was yet upright and majestic. The moment
I removed the tumor from the womb he seized it convulsively,
and exclaimed, ‘This is my trophy; I will return
with it to England, and it shall confound the traducers of
my child!’</p>

<p>“Here, you perceive, both character and life were sacrificed
by error of judgment on the part of those whose counsel
had been invoked. Without a due responsibility, heedless
of the distressing consequences, the medical gentlemen
rashly pronounced an opinion which consigned to an early
grave a pure and lovely being, and broke the very heart
strings of a devoted and confiding parent.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">PRECAUTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS TO PREGNANT WOMEN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a hygiene of pregnancy which the enceinte female
should observe, for by so doing, she will not only
make the period of her gestation less onerous to herself, but
she will be able to materially contribute toward the accomplishment
of a natural childbirth. Although pregnancy is
a physiological process, the conditions in the female economy,
under which this is carried on, are at variance with
those which are to be found in the unimpregnated state, and
as a consequence it rationally follows that the pregnant
female should endeavor to conform to the demands which
the altered relations require.</p>

<p>If the pregnant woman is properly clothed to begin with,
she will greatly mitigate some of the symptoms which very
often mar her well-being. The clothing should neither be
too heavy in summer, nor too light in winter, she must dress
so as to conform to the season and feel comfortable; but by
all means the chest and abdomen should be kept free from
pressure, the skirts must be supported from the shoulders,
and the corset also, should be dispensed with, and a waist
worn instead, one that partly answers the purpose of a corset,
and to which the skirts can be fastened or buttoned at
the same time. I have no respect nor patience for those
women who desire to conceal by tight lacing, the appearance
of their pregnancy. Motherhood, whether active or prospective,
is a divine function, and as creatures are the instruments
of the Creator, there is nothing to be ashamed of by
those who have complied with the usages of civilized peoples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and wherever an exhibition of pregnancy becomes indelicate,
a person who hopes or expects to be a mother
should not be. If a woman has the true characteristics to
make a good mother, she cannot, nor will she trifle with her
own health or that of her child; in truth, mothers cannot
begin too soon to consider the welfare of their offspring.</p>

<p>To guard against taking cold is one of the maxims, that
the pregnant woman should heed, especially during the last
half of gestation when the prominence of the abdomen
shortens the skirts in front and removes them off from the
limbs. Flannel drawers properly adapted to the limbs and
worn underneath the muslin ones affords the best protection
that can be adopted, and it replaces cumbersome skirts.
Sudden extreme variations of temperature should also be
avoided, like going from an overheated apartment into the
cold outside air, or into another cold chilly room. In making
these changes, one should gradually cool off, and then
by putting on additional clothing, wraps or shawls, the danger
of taking cold may be removed. Hot coffee or tea or
hot alcoholic beverages are equally as dangerous as overheated
apartments, for anything which stimulates the circulation
of the blood in an inordinate degree is liable to
produce a congestion of the placenta, and thus incite an
abortion; hence fevers of all kinds are known to have
brought about an expulsion of the fetus. On the whole,
either very hot or very cold temperatures are to be avoided,
for instance, prolonged staying in cold weather or lengthened
exposure to the rays of the sun should be prudently guarded
against by the pregnant female. Of course this is not to be
construed as meaning, that she should not partake of exercise
in the open fresh air&mdash;far from it, but the exercise
shall not be forced or driven, it shall at all times be voluntary
and passive, so that when a tired feeling comes on, she
can rest and refresh herself. The best time for these little
walks is in the morning and evening in the summer season
and in the middle of the day in cold weather. A rough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
uneven walk should be avoided because she may stumble;
jolting in either street cars or wagon is equally pernicious.
A great deal of stair climbing is injurious, and when it becomes
necessary it must be done slowly; running the sewing
machine has caused many miscarriages. Avoid running,
jumping, riding on horseback, and lifting heavy weights,
hanging laundried clothes on lines, in fact everything that can
strain the muscles, bear down, increase the intra-abdominal
pressure and excite the nervous system.</p>

<p>The prospective mother must resign her amusements at
evening entertainments in crowded halls or theaters, in
which the air becomes foul and overheated from large congregations
of persons. Here she is also threatened to be
jostled and jammed, and perhaps injured in other ways.
Her sleeping apartments should be thoroughly ventilated
through the day, and coition, if not entirely suspended, at
least restrained and only passively exercised, for any excess
of this nature is not only injurious to the child, but may
cause a miscarriage. It is not expected that the pregnant
woman should sit in the arm chair during the period of
gestation, far from it, but it is even greatly desired that she
continue her usual vocation. Exercise of a passive nature
is always wholesome, and for this reason it will be conducive
to good health if enough work is done over every day
to keep the system in gentle activity; the domestic duties of
a household will or should always furnish that. All good
women take a pride in their household affairs, if they do
not they are not good; and those who boast that they never
put their hands to anything in the house, have mistaken
their vocation as women, and are either indolent or worthless,
and often both. No one should boast of idleness,
rather be ashamed of it. Employment makes character; it
gives buoyancy to the spirit and tranquillity of mind. The
influence that an equable temperament exercises over the
nervous development of the unborn child may eventually
be demonstrated by its resistance to the shock of diseases
which superinduce convulsions and death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
It is not advisable to sleep during the day, it is better to
retire early after a light supper, so as to rest a few hours
before midnight. This makes one fresh and spry in the
morning, being on hand early in the morning, it gives
ample time to dispose of domestic duties, and thus avoid
confusion and rushing during the day.</p>

<p>Cleanliness is one of the cardinal virtues of the pregnant
woman&mdash;as pregnancy will be followed with childbirth, and
as cleanliness is but another name for <i>antiseptic</i>, and that will
guard against childbed fever, the importance of <i>cleanliness</i>
springs at once into unusual prominence. No person can be
filthy and slovenly during the entire period of gestation, and
then at the moment of confinement become clean, even if
in the last moment the person becomes bathed and brushed,
everything else around and about her is soiled and dirty,
unless she be taken to a lying-in home. Cleanliness must
be cultivated, and finally it becomes second nature. The
daily ablution of the external genitals should not be neglected,
and general bathing in water not altogether too warm, say
90 to 94 degrees F., twice a week will prove beneficial in
many ways. The linen that is worn, and that which is in
the bed should be kept sweet and clean, and cleaner than
ever on the day of confinement.</p>

<p>The mammæ of the pregnant woman are sometimes very
painful; as pregnancy advances they enlarge, the lacteal
glands become congested and swollen. To relieve this I
recommend the application of a liniment of equal parts
camphorated oil, laudanum, and tincture of belladonna
gently applied several times a day. The breasts should
always be extra well covered with flannel so as not to take
cold in them, otherwise an abscess may form in them long
before the child is born. If the nipples are sensitive it is
advisable to begin to harden them during the last few months
of gestation. Tannate of glycerine is perhaps the best thing
to apply for this purpose; it is best done by means of a small
camel’s hair brush. If the nipples are sunken into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
breast, and too short for subsequent use for the baby, it is
well to draw them out by means of a breast pump, the bowl
of a new clay pipe, or by employing a bottle from which the
air has been replaced by filling it with hot water and then
pouring it out; the mouth of the hot bottle is applied over
the depressed nipple, and as it cools off, the vacuum thus
formed draws the nipple out.</p>

<p>Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is often so annoying
and weakening that the strength of the patient becomes
seriously threatened, and hence some measures must be
employed to counteract it. A great variety of agents have
been suggested for this purpose. Tincture of nux vomica in
two or three drop doses every three or four hours is a useful
remedy; the oxalate of cerium is another valuable agent for
this purpose, in five to ten grain doses three times a day, but
a more valuable remedy than any other that I know, is the
Femina vaginal capsule, to be used every night at bedtime,
and in severe cases, also in the morning.</p>

<p>Salivation is not constantly an attendant upon pregnancy,
but when it does occur it is weakening and debilitating.
There are many remedies for this disorder, but one of the
most effectual ones is an occasional dose of Epsom salts, say
a teaspoonful in a half tumbler of water every other morning,
so as to produce free discharges from the bowels; when
salts are found objectionable, the Femina laxative syrup
taken in doses that have a similar effect will be a most excellent
substitute.</p>

<p>Constipation is one of the most common derangements
of the pregnant woman; it is the rule in which the exceptions
are few and far between. I do not include those cases of
costiveness which are habitual, and which are to be attributed
to carelessness in not responding to nature’s call when there
is an inclination, but to those in which constipation is contemporaneous
with pregnancy. We have already seen the
sympathy between the stomach and other organs in pregnancy,
and that a similar derangement should exist between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the uterus and rectum is not at all unreasonable, and, indeed,
it can be explained in that way. In the early months of
pregnancy, the torpor of the bowels may be due to the general
derangement which follows digestive disturbances; in
the latter months, the enlarged uterus presses against the
large intestines, so as to obstruct more or less the descent of
the feces into the rectum. This torpor of the bowels should
not be allowed to be unrelieved, for if permitted to continue
it may not only induce a miscarriage, but it is apt to cause
fever, headache and loss of appetite. Harsh cathartics
must not be employed; and if a simple enema of warm
water early every morning does not give the desired relief, I
would recommend a daily dose of Femina laxative syrup.
If it is found that in attempting to administer an enema, the
fluid is immediately returned, then it will probably be owing
to lumps of fecal matter which clog up the rectum; this
will likely give rise to more or less straining or bearing
down in the back passage, and to pains in the pelvis and
lower limbs, all of which is not without danger of exciting
premature labor pains; the fecal lumps must be removed
even if it becomes necessary to use the finger.</p>

<p>Diarrhea is the opposite condition of things, namely a
looseness of the bowels. This may be occasioned by improper
food, cold or any other cause capable of producing
diarrhea when pregnancy does not exist. Habitual costiveness
is often followed by diarrhea from the irritation which
the hardened feces excite. A dose of castor oil is sometimes
an efficient remedy for this variety of diarrhea, but when the
disease becomes obstinate and painful, the following remedy
can always be depended upon for relief:&mdash;</p>

<p>Bladder trouble is not infrequent in the early and last
stages of pregnancy; the causes of this were pointed out
when the symptoms of pregnancy were inquired into.
Recipe No. V is sometimes very useful to relieve this irritability,
or a Femina vaginal capsule introduced into the
vagina every night at bedtime, is sure to give the desired
relief.</p>

<p>The kidneys of pregnant women should not be neglected.
On this question Dumas, an eminent French authority, says:
“Physiological pregnancy, by modifying the quality and
quantity of the blood is a predisposing general cause of
albuminuria or Bright’s disease. But to produce the last a
cause must be added, and this may be due to a true pathological
state of the blood, a morbid condition of the kidney,
an accidental cause or mechanical pressure exerted by the
uterus, where it has acquired a sufficient size.” If the
pregnant woman notices that her urine becomes thick and
foamy, that her head aches and her limbs swell, she should
pay particular attention to keep her bowels free, and besides
drink a cupful of buchu tea every night at bedtime.</p>

<p>Palpitation of the heart is a source of great annoyance
to some women in the earlier months of pregnancy. Women
of a nervous temperament and those who are of a full plethoric
habit are most likely to suffer from distressing palpitation.
Nervous women should take ten grains of bromide of
sodium in half tumbler of water at bedtime, and only a
very light supper, while those who are full blooded should
keep their bowels freely opened and remove all pressure
from the chest and abdomen by wearing the clothing loose.</p>

<p>Pain in the abdomen walls from the sixth to the ninth
month is particularly apt to occur in the first pregnancy.
The abdominal walls offer a firm resistance to the growth of
the uterus, and being thus put on the stretch by the combined
development of the child and the womb, the muscles
and skin become excessively tender and painful. I have
recommended for this complaint:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mix and apply by means of gentle friction every night

<p>Itching of the external organs will sometimes make the
life of the pregnant woman miserable. I have seen it in so
aggravated a form that the constant scratching to which the
patient had recourse in the hope of being relieved, lacerated
the parts so that they became ulcerated. The causes of this
condition are numerous, the patient from motives of delicacy
conceals her suffering until she can endure it no longer. It
also happens that pregnancy has nothing at all to do with
the itching for it may be due to diabetes, inattention to personal
cleanliness, the presence of small parasitic insects, acrid
discharges from the vagina, or from pinworms in the rectum.</p>

<p>If owing to parasites, mercurial ointment will cure the
disease, if from vaginal discharges warm vaginal douches
in which the Femina antiseptic tablets are dissolved will be
the efficient remedy, and after a thorough ablution, the application
by means of a camel’s hair brush of a solution of
cocaine will relieve the itching.</p>

<p>Hemorrhoids, or piles, frequently torment the pregnant
female beyond reasonable endurance. Piles may be either
external or internal, in either case they are exceedingly apt
to be very painful. When they occur in pregnancy they are
due, in the first place, to an obstruction to the free return of
blood to the heart by the enlarged uterus pressing on the
large venous trunks and secondly, to constipation, which as
we have learned is so frequently an attendant upon pregnancy.
If the piles bleed it may give temporary relief, but
if the bleeding occurs too frequently, the patient becomes
pale and weak from the loss of blood. I know of no painful
and troublesome malady in which the application of a little
common sense has greater brilliant results than in piles, yet
of all maladies, with perhaps the exception of catarrh of
the nose, it is the most abused by senseless and meddlesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
doctoring. The first step to engage the attention of the
patient is to regulate the bowels and overcome the constipation;
the passages must be kept soft and soluble, unless this
is accomplished all the other efforts fail. The constipation
must be partly relieved by proper dieting, and partly by
suitable remedies. A simple bland diet, for a short time at
least, is very useful; bread and milk, thin milk gruel, fruits
and vegetables are to be preferred; abstain from solids, from
meat and eggs and everything of the nature of beer and
wine or alcohol, even coffee is irritating; while the disease
is at its height eat sparingly of everything, but drink plenty
of water, warm or cold, but not iced cold. The bowels should
be regulated by taking a mild, efficient laxative, none
being better than the Femina laxative syrup. Another
precaution, very essential to success, is that after each stool
the parts are gently bathed and washed with tepid or cool
water by means of a soft sponge; gentle pressure can be
exerted at the same time so as to assist the piles to return
into the rectum. If they cannot be returned in this manner,
the patient must learn to use her index finger and with it
oiled with a little sweet oil or vaseline the piles are gradually
shoved back into the rectum which alone relieves the suffering,
because it relieves the strangulation and swelling which
the sphincter muscle of the rectum causes. The pushing
back after each stool and even between times is one of the
essential features of a successful home treatment for piles,
and it must be kept up for years, if necessary, to insure comfort
and to guard against a relapse. Better than plain oil
or vaseline is the nutgall ointment to be had at any drug
store, but if the pain and distress continue use the following
recipe:&mdash;</p>

bedtime or whenever they come down and have to be returned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
a few days in bed will materially aid in the recovery.</p>

<p>The diet of the pregnant female should be made a special
study for upon the regimen of food not only depends her immediate
comfort, but its ultimate effect on the process of
parturition is equally marked. I do not agree with the
opinion, laid down by some of the highest authorities, that
“as far as eating and drinking is concerned, the pregnant
woman may continue her accustomed diet.” I believe that
there is a diet peculiarly adapted to the pregnant woman
and very beneficial to her if she lives up to it. Stimulants of
every kind are not good; wine, beer, whisky and even
strong coffee and tea, as well as highly seasoned food, salty
or sour salads should not be eaten.</p>

<p>How very often does it happen that a very strong, muscular,
robust, healthy young woman, who, during her entire
period of gestation, was in the best of health and spirits, and
from whom, from all appearances one may predict that she
will have an “easy time” in her confinement, quite the
opposite occurs. And why as a matter of fact and experience
is this not so, is indeed an interesting inquiry. I believe
that the answer to this question can be made so plain
and reasonable, that a mere statement of a few simple facts
will make it apparent.</p>

<p>The process of delivery, presupposes the contraction of
the uterus and the descent of the child down into the pelvic
canal and its further passage through the floor of the pelvis.</p>

<p>The pelvic floor (see page 228) forms the bottom of the
pelvic canal through which the child must be forced. The
vagina is the opening through this floor, and this is composed
of the muscles and membranes of the vagina, the skin,
two layers of fascea, the triangular ligaments of the bladder
and a group of interlacing muscles. In the birth of the
child all these tissues are forced to relax to such an extent,
that the vaginal canal (or the vagina) will be sufficiently
widened or dilated to allow the child to pass through into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the world. A moment’s reflection will at once make clear,
that in a strong muscular person, the resistance to the necessary
dilatation will become correspondingly great, because
the muscles are so strong and tense. I have attended some
women where the muscles under the excitement of labor
pains felt as tense and hard, as though they were made of
strong india rubber. It is apparent that the muscular
resistance that is offered by these strong, tense muscles,
clearly obstructs and delays the passage or birth of the child
and it makes the strongest labor pains of no avail. And experience
teaches, that the progress of labor is slow and the
delivery generally prolonged until the pains and physical
suffering of many hours, exhaust and relax the muscular
resistance so that the child is allowed to pass. If the above
truths were generally understood and generally recognized
they might be guarded against by a proper dietetic regulation,
and thus an infinite amount of suffering could be
avoided.</p>

<p>Painless childbirth is only relative, and in the absolute
meaning of the term it is not true, and for this reason, that
severe contractions of the womb are always painful, and extreme
tension of tissues and muscles such as the passage of
the child will occasion in its passage through the soft parts
is also more or less painful and there is no natural childbirth
possible without both these factors being present.
Painless childbirth in its absolute sense, as a scientific fact,
is not true, but to assure a comparatively painless childbirth
in accordance with scientific facts which are capable of demonstration
is not only reasonable but absolutely true.</p>

<p>The term “food” is understood to be all those substances,
solid and liquid, which are used for the process of nutrition.
For our present purpose foods may be divided into three
classes: <i>carbo-hydrates</i>, <i>albuminoids</i>, and <i>phosphates</i>.</p>

<p>The carbo-hydrates furnish fat and warmth, as an example
we have starch, sugar, and fats. Persons who are fed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
principally upon this class become warm and fat, but will
lack muscle and nerve.</p>

<p>The albuminoids are also termed nitrogenous substances,
and constitute the muscle making material. They are derived
both from animal and vegetable sources, and in their
most concentrated form we find them in eggs, milk or cheese,
and in meats also in certain meals; wheat, for instance, contains
fourteen per cent of nitrate or muscle-making material.</p>

<p>Phosphates are generally taken into the system as phosphate
of lime contained in certain foods we eat, as fish, lobster,
beef, Southern corn, peas and beans, barley, sweet
potatoes and oats.</p>

<p>It is obvious from what was said of painful and prolonged
childbirth, that the pregnant woman should avoid as much
as possible nitrogenous or muscle-making food; she must
starve her muscular system as much as it is possible for her to
do, and the result will be that her muscles will become soft
and relaxable and that means a comparatively easy or painless
childbirth. In Europe, the peasantry who eat meat
sparingly or very seldom, have comparatively little pain,
because vegetables enter largely into their daily diet; the
same is true in Asiatic countries where the staple is rice,
the throes of labor are very light. The squaws of our Indian
tribes are remarkable for the little pain they suffer in childbirth
and for the shortness of its duration, and the recuperation
is also a speedy one, for an Indian woman will travel
or be about in a few days after her confinement with her
pappoose on her back.</p>

<p>I would recommend to the pregnant woman to live as much
as it is possible for her to do on a fruit and vegetable diet.
Her meals must be taken at regular intervals, otherwise
derangement of the stomach is sure to follow. Excess in
eating even the plainest kind of food must be studiously
avoided, and all food must be eaten slowly and thoroughly
masticated. Wheaten bread or rice and milk diluted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
water should form the main diet. Thoroughly cooked garden
vegetables and fresh, ripe fruit like apples, grapes, peaches,
plums, etc., should be used in summer, and some of the same
fruits canned in winter, or dried fruits slowly simmered until
they are soft; it is always better to soak dried fruit for several
hours or overnight before it is put over to boil.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">WHILE IN CHILDBED.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> childbed is usually meant the period of delivery, but
I mean to include the lying-in period, from the moment
the mother has the first signs of her approaching delivery,
to the time when she is supposed to have fully recovered
and is able to be out of her bed and about.</p>

<p>If the suggestions that were thrown out in a former chapter
are complied with, there will be little reason for uneasiness
for the prospective mother, but it will be conducive
to her welfare if she be buoyant in spirit and hopeful of the
best possible result.</p>

<p>The nurse should be a quiet, orderly woman, and neither
too young or too old; she should have had experience in
nursing during confinements and taking care of newborn
babies; with all this she should not be set in her ways, but
should be accommodating and active, so that she will carry
out conscientiously the instructions of the attending physician.</p>

<p>The choice of a physician should not be delayed until
the last moment, but it should be made several months before
the expectation of delivery, and a woman should never
engage a doctor for her confinement, unless she knows that
he has had practical experience in at least ten cases of confinement,
for some of our leading medical colleges and all of
the poor ones, graduate hundreds of doctors each year who
never attended a single case of confinement, and some have,
even, never seen one; yet the newly fledged doctors are
turned loose upon the unsophisticated communities to attend
women in the most trying period of their lives, and at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
time when both the experience and science of her physician
should be her sheet anchor of hope. A physician who is
not always sober, of good moral character, and cleanly in
his habits and appearance, should never be allowed in the
lying-in chamber, nor one who is prating of the many severe
confinements he has attended, or who boastingly speaks of
the number of times it was necessary for him to use instruments,
for it is quite likely, that the many severe confinements
of which he spoke, were either fictitious or due to his
ignorance of the subject, and the frequency with which
he used instruments was owing to a lack of patience on his
part or to a desire to be meddlesome and make himself officious.
There are a great many medical gentlemen who
are not charlatans in disguise, and these should be singled
out. The pregnant female should have herself thoroughly
washed and bathed just before confinement, and the vagina
should be thoroughly rinsed out with half a gallon of warm
water in which a tablespoonful of pulverized borax has
been dissolved; this precaution will wash out any infectious
germs that may cause inflammation.</p>

<p>The bed in which the confinement is to take place should
be scrupulously clean, and in order to insure this, it should
be made a rule that the bedstead be taken apart, and taken
out-of-doors where it is thoroughly washed and afterwards
exposed to the purifying influence of the sun and air. The
mattress must also be taken out for a similar dusting and
cleaning, and kept for a time exposed to sun and air. The
confinement chamber should go through the same renovating
ordeal; the carpet of this particular chamber should be
taken up, the floor thoroughly scrubbed and the walls and
ceiling washed off and whitened. It will be better if a few
clean mats or rugs can be substituted, and the old carpet
not relaid until after the confinement, when the woman is
up and around again. These precautions will guard against
the possibility of infection and the dangers of childbed fever,
and the many different phases of inflammation which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the result of carelessness in the details of cleanliness. Of
course, the nurse and attending physician must be equally
anxious of their own personal cleanliness. If he or she
leave any of the infectious diseases, like scarlet fever, measles,
typhoid fever, erysipelas and puerperal fever, either of
them is quite sure to communicate the contagion to the innocently
ignorant lying-in woman, and entail upon her
endless suffering and death. In France and Germany,
stringent precautions for nurse and physician against the
dangers of infections are mandatory under the laws, but in
free America such legal injunctions would be considered as
curtailing our liberty; in the meantime, innocent lives are
sacrificed, through lack of systematized regulations, at the
cost of liberty degenerating into license.</p>

<p>On the day of confinement the bed is held in readiness
for the occasion, by spreading over the mattress a large
piece of oiled cloth, or what is preferable, rubber cloth; this
must reach up high enough so as to afford proper protection
and lap over the side of mattress and bedstead. Beside the
bed an extra mat should be laid, to catch any fluid that
may run down the rubber cloth on the floor.</p>

<p>The preliminary signs of labor pains that make themselves
felt by the pregnant female, are of considerable interest
to her and I believe, that if she will familiarize herself
with their character she will have less anxiety and more
confidence in a happy termination of her condition. For
some days, and occasionally for two or three weeks prior to
the commencement of actual labor, a sense of uneasiness
about the uterus will be felt by the female; this uneasiness
will be observed several times during the day and night.
When the patient complains of this local disturbance, she
may feel, by placing her hands over the region of the womb,
that the organ becomes hard for the time being, and as soon
as the sense of uneasiness passes away, the womb becomes
soft again. These symptoms are called the “independent
contractions of the uterus” and in the first pregnancy they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
are felt earlier than afterwards. This is simply a muscular
irritability of the womb and is not accompanied by “bearing
down” which is the true characteristic of labor. These
preliminary skirmishes must not be mistaken for the commencement
of labor, otherwise great mischief may be done
by harassing the case into a premature delivery which
might sacrifice the child. The pregnant female will often
become very anxious when she first experiences these independent
pains and she may imagine that something is
wrong; for this apprehension there is no reason, because experience
has taught that the greater this local disturbance
before the beginning of labor, the more favorable the progress
of labor will be when true labor pains set in.</p>

<p>“The righting of the organ” will be observed for some
days previous to the confinement, by a change of the position
of the pregnant womb. The womb places itself, as it were,
in readiness for the expulsion of the child, which is shortly
to begin. This is done by the body of the uterus inclining
forwards and sinking downwards, and correspondingly
relieving from pressure the organs of the chest; this makes
breathing easier, and in proportion as the body of the womb
comes down, so will the lower portion of the organ descend,
and this may give rise to irritation of the bladder and frequent
desire to pass water; sometimes the passage of urine
may be entirely obstructed, so that the water must be drawn
off by means of a catheter. Some women become very
nervous just before the commencement of labor; this is generally
due to fear or anxiety, for which there is no reason,
and agreeable companionship will generally dispel all evil
forebodings and restore her to self-confidence.</p>

<p>Labor pains are divided into <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>, and this distinction
is entirely based upon their different sources.
True labor pains are due to the contractions of the muscles
of the uterus, and at the beginning they are slight. They
commence in the back and run on down to the thighs; one
feature about them is that they are intermittent, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
that they are not continuous; there is always an interval,
especially at the beginning of labor, in which there is no
pain at all. When labor sets in, the pains are grinding or
cutting, but as soon as the mouth of the uterus is fairly
opened or dilated, the character of the pain changes to a
bearing down or forcing out nature. If the hand is applied
over the region of the womb, during the presence of a pain,
the organ can be felt hardened and swollen; this subsides
with the pain, and in the interval, the organ relaxes. This
is a wise provision of nature, for it gives the woman an opportunity
to recover and regain fresh strength for each succeeding
effort. False labor pain has no connection with the process
of child-bearing, but is only an incidental complication.
It may be caused by gas in the intestines, indigestion,
diarrhea, constipation, disease of the kidney, neuralgia, or
rheumatism of the muscles of the abdomen or bowels, and
by the passage of gallstones; where the false pains have been
traced to their origin they can be properly dealt with.</p>

<p>A muco-sanguineous discharge from the vagina is
another sign that labor has begun, but it will sometimes
happen that it is absent, and this constitutes a <i>dry labor</i>. The
mucous discharge which is thus observed, subserves a very
important object in lubricating the parts and relaxing the
neck of the womb and the vagina. There is often a slight
tinge of blood, due, perhaps, to a rupture of small blood vessels
in the mouth of the womb; this is called a show, which
some women have for several days before labor commences.</p>

<p>“Stages of labor” are arbitrary divisions, so as to simplify
the explanation of the entire process of labor from the time
the womb begins to act, up to the last act of parturition,
which is the expulsion of the afterbirth, and these have
usually been divided into three stages. The first stage is
the dilation or opening of the mouth of the womb, including
also the breaking of the membraneous sac which holds
the fluid in which the child floats, so as to protect it from
pressure that the walls of the uterus would be continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
exercising, which would prevent its proper development.
In this stage the woman should not exert herself by bearing
down; this will only waste her strength which she should
preserve for the second stage, when the mouth of the womb
has opened and the progress of the child into the world has
commenced; during this stage, the female should make an
attempt to relieve her bladder, and if she has had no stool
for several hours before, it will be a good thing to use an
enema of warm water, and empty the bowels.</p>

<p>The second stage of labor begins when the bag of water
has broken and the waters escape; the contractions of the
womb increase now in violence and become decidedly of a
bearing down character. At this period the patient should
be furnished with something that she may grasp with her
hands; a sheet attached to the post of the bed is the best for
this purpose, and with her feet steadily braced, holding her
breath she bears down whenever a pain comes on; bearing
down between pains, only exhausts the patient and does no
good. During this stage of labor, the pain in the patient’s
back will sometimes become intense, she exclaims: Oh, dear,
doctor, my poor back feels like breaking! what shall I do?
The greatest relief that can be given at this time is to support
the back with the flat surface of the hand, or by folding
a towel and placing it under the back, the two ends
being held by assistants.</p>

<p>As the birth of the child progresses and it approaches the
vulva, the patient will feel an urgent inclination to go to
stool; upon this she must not insist, for at this advanced
period of labor she may injure herself and child. The
desire is caused by the pressure of the child’s head against
the rectum; any fecal matter that is thus pressed out should
be at once removed by the nurse.</p>

<p>The third stage of labor consists in the expulsion of the
placenta or afterbirth.</p>

<p>There is a natural detachment of the placenta and a natural
expulsion, but one must have the patience to wait.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
What presumption of the officious doctor or midwife to suppose
that nature was so derelict as to require some meddlesome
assistant, immediately after the birth of the child, to
drag or pull on the placenta: no, more than that, carry the
hand up into the cavity of the womb and detach the placenta
with the fingers and bring it down and out. When I first
started out to practice I was foolish enough to believe and
do the same thing, and afterwards I congratulated myself
how wonderfully skilled I was, but now I am convinced that
this procedure was due to ignorance of the laws of nature.
The truth of the matter is, that the sooner and the more one
pulls and feels on the placenta, the more irritable the womb
becomes, and the more will the uterus contract, as though it
protested against interference.</p>

<p>I have had it happen, and others must have had the same
experience, that the womb closes and contracts firmly in ten
to twenty minutes after delivery, the afterbirth becoming
tightly inclosed so that one not experienced would be frightened
into the belief, Oh! here the placenta has grown to the
womb. This is a delusion which may lead to an interference
that may entail dangerous consequences to the mother.
The condition is simply this, that as the afterbirth was not
completely detached at the birth of the child, the uterus contracted
immediately upon and around the retained placenta,
and for two physiological reasons: (1) to accomplish the very
object which was imagined was not accomplished, namely,
by contracting, the uterus naturally peels itself off from the
placental attachment, and (2) were it not for this immediate
contraction of the uterus after the expulsion of the child,
the mother would likely <i>flood</i> from the uterine vessels of the
partly detached placenta. Of late years I never experienced
a single case in which the placenta did not detach itself, and
if I had known twenty years ago as I do now, I never would
have had one.</p>

<p>After the delivery of the child, the woman should be
made as comfortable as possible for the time being, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
by the time the child is washed and dressed, the placenta
will generally present itself in the vulva. If the afterbirth
has not come away at once there is no need to become
alarmed. I have waited for six to eight hours for that event
to take place, and if there is delay over an hour, two teaspoonfuls
of fluid extract of ergot will so excite contractions
of the womb that its contents will be expelled.</p>

<p>Whether the afterbirth comes away immediately after the
birth of the child, or is delayed, it must not interfere with putting
the mother in a warm, dry, comfortable condition.
Everything that is damp from perspiration or wet from the
waters, both dress and bed linen must be removed and replaced
with warmed, dry, clean linen; this insures against
taking cold. To me it looks like a crime against science and
nature to allow a woman to remain in the wet and soiled bed
after her confinement for twelve or more hours, and the doctor
or nurse who permits this, is ignorant and negligent of
his duties.</p>

<p>After the placenta is removed, the binder or bandage is
applied; this is simply a piece of unbleached muslin about
eighteen inches wide and long enough to reach one and a
half times around the body; it should be brought down to
cover the hips and then fastened with strong safety pins.
The object of the binder is to give support to the flabby and
relaxed abdominal muscles, which is a great comfort and aid
to restore the muscles to their former shape.</p>

<p>How a woman should lie after confinement is of much
greater importance than how she should lie during childbirth;
in fact it does not matter much how she lies during
labor so long as she feels comfortable, but after confinement
and during her convalescence, her position in bed has an
important bearing on her recovery; to avoid repetition I refer
the reader to pages 73 and 250 of this work. Vaginal
douches of hot water, of a temperature of 104 degrees F. serve
a very useful purpose in washing out the secretions that
will naturally accumulate in the vagina, and after a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
time undergo septic decomposition; these rinsings also assist
nature to repair and heal the tissues. The quantity of fluid
that should be used at once is half a gallon of water in which
a tablespoonful of powdered borax has been dissolved.
Great care should be exercised by the nurse, lest the bed
and linen of the patient get wet, and through this she become
liable to take cold. The second day after the delivery is
about the right time to begin using the douche, and about
this time the mother should also get a mild laxative, either
of castor oil or of Femina laxative syrup, which is very palatable
and suitable for the occasion.</p>

<p>The last throes of labor which usher the child into the
world constitute the climax of the parturient effort and as
there is little or no interval between the pains, the pains
at this period have been appropriately termed <i>double</i> labor
pains. There is more or less excitement and apprehension
on the part of the lying-in female and the experienced practitioner
or nurse will concentrate his effort to calm and encourage
the sufferer in the last minutes of her travail.</p>

<p>It is best to wait a few minutes after the child is born
before tying the cord, so as to give the circulation time to
equalize itself; especially is this desirable when the cord was
wound around the child’s neck or when it is otherwise compressed.
The cord is tied about an inch above the navel,
and half an inch higher the cord is cut with a pair of sharp
scissors. In the meantime, the nurse, if properly instructed,
will have in readiness on the side of the bed a warm flannel
or blanket which is to receive the little stranger. There is
a proper way to pick up a newborn babe, so that it will not
roll or slip from the hands, which I have known to happen.
The little baby must be taken hold off with the same gentle
firmness as an older child. To prevent any accident, place
the posterior surface of the child’s neck in the space bounded
by the thumb and index finger of one hand, and with the
other hand gently seize the thighs and in this manner place
it into the blanket, to be conveyed to a warm place of safety,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
newborn child must be kept warm, for its very life
may depend upon it. After the mother has had her temporary
wants satisfied, the nurse prepares for the <i>first toilet</i> of the
child.</p>

<p>The care of the baby is differently understood by different
persons, and as a result of this difference of opinion I
have observed a great many unfortunate consequences.
There is no reason why the care of the baby should be resigned
to custom and habit for both are often extremely hazardous
to the life of the child, and this I will illustrate in the course
of my remarks.</p>

<p>How often are newly born infants taken into a cold room
in which, from the arrangement of the doors, a draft sweeps
through whenever a person goes out or comes in? How the
child is laid bare in readiness for the ordeal of a thorough
cleaning! The child is generally first rubbed with oil and
afterwards put into a bath tub or some other vessel of sufficient
capacity to drown several babies at once. It is now
treated to a soaping process, after which, by means of a
cloth indifferently selected, the child is scrubbed with an
ambition which would have been laudable if applied to the
nurse’s own person, but why this little innocent should be
the object of such abuse has been a standing wonder to me
from the time I witnessed the first outrage. By the time the
nurse gets through bathing the child, it is shivering and
blue from cold. I had not been practicing medicine very
long before I became appalled by this barbarous procedure,
nor had I practiced very long before I was called upon to
sign a number of death certificates of infants who contracted
colds that resulted in bronchitis, pneumonia and congestion
of the lungs, which caused their death.</p>

<p>There is no sense in this dousing and soaping of a newborn
child, and aside from its danger by undue exposure, it
is absolutely useless. But habit is often so thoroughly intrenched
that the good judgment which persons exercise in
most of their duties may become entirely suspended, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
this force of habit has established a custom that is well-nigh
universal.</p>

<p>My method of directing the first toilet of the baby is
without the possible dangers to which I have referred, for it
has for its object not only to clean the child, but to dress
it as quickly as possible and again wrap it in flannel.
Warmth is the life of the newborn babe; it does not require
much food, if any, the first twenty-four or forty-eight
hours of its life, but it requires to be kept warm. The room
in which the child is to be cleansed must be warm and free
from draft, and if there is a fire in the chamber where the
mother is, the toilet of the child had better be made here
under her eyes and those of the physician. The nurse or
person delegated to dress the baby provides herself with a
vase or bowl of warm water and a saucerful of warm olive
oil or vaseline and a few soft cloths. She then seats herself
in a low chair, and by means of a small piece of flannel she
applies the oil all over the baby’s body, rubbing in an extra
quantity in the armpits, groins and other places where the
cheesy substance is thickest. When the oil has softened the
sebaceous material, take a soft muslin cloth, provided for
the purpose, and beginning on the head the oil is wiped off
again; where there are blood stains left, wash these off with
a soft flannel cloth; at the same time the eyes are to be bathed
and the mouth washed out. I have not mentioned the use
of soap, for the reason that it is not at all necessary and very
often injurious. The oil removes all the caseous matter and
what oil remains is rather an advantage than otherwise;
it preserves the warmth of the child and protects its skin.
If the soap comes in contact with the eyes of the infant it
often becomes a fruitful source of that annoying and often
dangerous disease of the eyes that is technically termed
<i>purulent ophthalmia</i>.</p>

<p>Never apply oil or any other greasy substance to the
cord before it comes off, for this will prevent its drying and
delay its falling off. When the cord has come off, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
simply keep the navel clean by washing it daily with a little
warm borax water and afterwards apply a small compress on
which has been smeared a little zinc ointment. Always see
to it that the baby is lying dry and use dusting powder
freely; the <i>precipitated chalk</i> is the best and cheapest infant
powder that can be used. The child that is nursed on its
mother’s breasts has little to fear from overfeeding, yet it
should not be allowed to hang on the nipple too long or
sleep with the nipple in its mouth. Nurse the child every
two hours during the day and awaken it if it should sleep
to give it its nourishment, but at night allow it to sleep as
long as it wants to; this will cultivate regular habits in the
child and it will thrive much better. If the baby cries and
is restless between times do not imagine that it is always
hungry, but rather colicky, for which there is nothing better
than the old German domestic remedy, <i>fennel seed tea</i>; of this
give the baby all it will drink every day and until it is a
year old.</p>

<p>Sore nipples are a great annoyance to a mother and often
very obstinate to treatment. The skin covering the nipple
is made exceedingly tender by the sucking of the child’s
mouth and in a few days it cracks and becomes fissured.
Sometimes, the pain that the mother endures whenever the
infant nurses is excruciating, for every time the child is put
to the breasts the cracks open anew. The most fruitful cause
of this condition is to allow the child to hold the nipple in
its mouth when it does not nurse or perhaps to allow it to
retain the nipple in its mouth while it sleeps.</p>

<p>This practice must be at once discontinued, and the child
must be at once removed from the breast as soon as it is
satisfied. The nipples should be washed with borax water,
and then a salve should be made by mixing the yellow of
one egg with half an ounce of Peruvian balsam. This is to
be applied by means of a camel’s hair brush to the sore
nipple every time after the child is through nursing. Should
the nipple be too sensitive and the suction of the child too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
painful, then a breast pump had better be used for a few
days and the child not applied until the teat has sufficiently
improved.</p>

<p>Abscess of the breast constitutes a distressing complication
of the puerperal condition, inflicting upon the patient
intense suffering, and very often leading to a long
delay in recovery. It may be due to cold, and in one case it
developed from this cause two months before confinement,
but this is an exception. Sore nipples are a fruitful cause,
for the soreness of nursing makes the mother reluctant to
have the child draw all the milk out, hence, the breast
cakes and hardens with the above result. It also is due to
neglect in not having the nipple properly drawn out; or to
a foolish custom, derived from remote ancestry not to allow
the infant to be put to the breast for two or three days after
its birth. In this way the milk ducts become greatly distended,
inflammation sets in, which, if not properly arrested
will terminate in an abscess. If gentle friction of camphorated
oil and hot, moist compresses or poultices do not
enable the child to draw out the secretion, a young pup
should be obtained, for he draws with a gentleness and activity
which surpasses the most perfect machine. The
patient must drink sparingly of fluids and properly support
the breasts by means of handkerchiefs placed under them
and made to cross the shoulders, and the bowels should
be thoroughly opened. Should an abscess form it should
be opened by a free incision, and the poultice discontinued,
but instead a wad of absorbent cotton should be applied and
the breast tightly bandaged with the handkerchief.</p>

<p class="pch">DISEASES PECULIAR TO CHILDREN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> diseases of children that I propose to inquire into,
are not those of so serious a nature as to require the skill of
a physician, but rather those trivial ailments which are
common among children of tender age and which neither
good care nor healthy surroundings seem to be able to ward
off. And for this reason, mothers and nurses should familiarize
themselves with these ailments and their appropriate
treatment, for trivial as they may seem to begin with, if
permitted to go on uncontrolled, they often lead to more
serious and perhaps fatal consequences.</p>

<p>A coated tongue in children is not always a sign of
digestive disturbance, for most nurslings have a white coated
tongue in the first three or four weeks of their lives. With
the ancients, and even up to within a recent period, the
tongue was considered the <i>mirror of the stomach</i>; this was a
delusion because nothing definite or of great importance can
be deciphered in any case from the appearance of the tongue
alone, but this superstition became so deeply rooted in the
minds of the public, that even now a medical examination
is considered incomplete unless the physician says <i>put your
tongue out</i>, for the purpose of a physical inspection.</p>

<p>When the child loses its appetite and the stomach and
bowels become deranged, the tongue generally becomes
coated. Children who are overfed and in whom the food
is not digested, may have a thick fur over the tongue, but
as a rule only on the back of the tongue there is a whitish
coat. In diseases of the mouth that are purely local, the
tongue is sometimes coated, quite independently of any disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of the stomach, as for instance in thrush, in catarrhal inflammation
of the mouth, diphtheria, burns and other injuries.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Catarrh of the mouth is an inflammation of the mucous
membrane and is recognized by redness and increased
secretion. It is most intense on the tongue, which presents
the appearance as though it were coated with raspberry
syrup. Sometimes the redness is most on the inside of the
cheeks and soft palate, while the tongue is covered with soft
fur. The inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
mouth, extends in aggravated cases to the throat and nasal
passages and along the Eustachian tube into the ear. There
is many a baby suffering, no one knows from what, when it
has an earache due to this cause. When the catarrh has
existed for some time, clear, minute water-vesicles rise upon
the tongue, gums and mucous membrane of the lips and
cheeks. These burst and leave behind them small, flat ulcers,
which in the first few days run together and present large,
flat, ulcerated surfaces. The children become feverish and
refuse to eat and drink for days, partly because to do so, pains
them and partly from a loss of appetite.</p>

<p>The most common cause is the eruption of the teeth.
Mothers of experience know that when the baby drools, it is
teething, and if she examines a little closer she will discover
the catarrhal condition described. Another cause is the old-fashioned
sugar teat with its souring contents; so is the
nursing food, when either too hot or too cold, and in older
children irregular or improper food has the same effect, for
instance, sour ripe fruit eaten in excess.</p>

<p>The treatment for catarrh of the mouth is simple and
successful if directed to the removal of the causes that we
have enumerated. The mouth should be cleansed every few
hours with a little borax water, and the febrile symptoms
generally subside with a dose of mild laxative.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Putrid sore mouth is an aggravated stage of the above
affection; it begins on the borders of the gums as inflamed
patches coated with a thin layer of yellow mucus. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
slightest touch of the ulcerated places causes bleeding, and
the affection can be recognized at quite a distance from the
mouth by the sense of smell. The disease is contagious and
may be imparted from one child to another. Carious teeth
are the predisposing agents; mercury or <i>calomel</i> in repeated
and large doses produces a similar effect. A very simple
and efficient remedy for this affection is a saturated solution
of chlorate of potassa, in the proportion of a teaspoonful to a
teacupful of boiling water; with this solution wash the mouth
out every two hours, and allow a little to be swallowed at the
same time; children under one year of age can swallow ten
drops; under two years, twenty drops; under three, thirty
drops, and larger ones can take a teaspoonful.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Thrush, sprue, or soor is another type of sore mouth
that falls to the lot of some children. It resembles
catarrh of the mouth, but must be considered a different
disease, inasmuch that it is proven to be due to a fungus
growth. The disease begins with a change of color from the
natural bright red, to a livid, dark red color; the entire
mucous membrane of the mouth is uniformly discolored;
the discoloration never occurs in spots, and the surface presents
the appearance as if a thick coat of raspberry syrup
had been smeared upon it. The mucous membrane becomes
dry and sticky and the secretion of the mouth is acid. On
inspecting the mouth the fungi can be seen, at first as small
white points if only existing a few hours, but their growth
is very rapid, and they soon form large white patches, which
may run together and cover the entire mouth. The treatment
is directed towards removing the cause in the first
place; if the child has been using the sugar teat that must
be discontinued, and even a milk diet should be suspended
for a few days, on account of its containing sugar and cheesy
matter, and instead the child should be fed with a little
thickening of arrow root or wheaten flour. The mouth
must be kept sweet and clean with a solution of borax
applied with a small camel’s hair brush; if the disease is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
obstinate, dissolve the borax in creosote water obtained from
a druggist, and apply this every hour or two as above.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Parotitis, or mumps, is an inflammation of the parotid
or salivary gland. The disease shows itself as a swelling
between the angle of the lower jaw and the ear. Several
days before the swelling and pain begin, the children feel
tired, ill-humored, feverish, lose their appetite, lounge around
or voluntarily take to bed. Nervous children show brain
symptoms; they complain of headache, are delirious and
have convulsions. After two or three days they begin to
feel pain behind the jaw, and when they open the mouth,
masticate, or on slight pressure, the pain becomes aggravated.
The swelling over the corresponding cheek extends to the
lower eyelid and back to the neck. The skin over the swelling
becomes inflamed and red. In males the swelling may
suddenly move from the neck to the testes, while in the
female it may strike on the mammæ.</p>

<p>The course of mumps is usually favorable, but there is a
possibility of an abscess forming, and this may break directly
outward, or burrow backwards and burst into the ear,
perforating the ear drum, causing lifelong deafness. I have
had one case in which the disease went to the brain; the
little boy, a child of seven, died. The patient who has
mumps must be kept warm; over the swelling apply hot
poultices for three or four days, and besides wrap the entire
head and neck in flannel. If the swelling is painful, and
the child in robust health, a few leeches applied to the swelling
will relieve the pain and have a good effect on the cause
of the disease. Belladonna ointment is a valuable remedy
for older children, but with babies it must be used with extreme
care. The diet must be bland and light; bread and
milk, or gruel, is the most appropriate. Give a little paregoric
at night to soothe the restlessness, and open the bowels with
the Femina laxative syrup.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Tonsilitis or quinsy sore throat is often mistaken
for the mumps, but to the experienced practitioner or nurse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
there is no resemblance, and to mistake one for the other is
almost impossible. In tonsilitis the cheek never swells, the
swelled tonsils being felt only behind the jaw and quite below
the ear. Tonsilitis occurs oftener than mumps, and unlike
the latter affection, when the patient has had one attack of
quinsy he is likely to have a recurrence whenever he gets a
fresh cold. The disease begins with difficult deglutition,
pain, heat and dryness in the throat, and always more or
less fever, from which some children become quite delirious.
The affected tonsils become as large as pigeon eggs, and
can be readily felt beneath the angle of the lower jaw. The
swollen tonsils are red and dotted with yellowish spots,
which is due to the suppuration of the follicles of which the
gland is composed. If both swell at the same time so that
they touch each other, symptoms of suffocation may ensue.
The writer suffered from tonsilitis when he was a student,
and the pain was indeed excruciating for a time. The pain
is sometimes greater in swallowing fluids than solids. In
examining the mouth a little skill is required. Some children
are so well trained that they will respond at once, and
then by means of a spoon handle the tongue is depressed,
and the tonsils come into view. Others again have their own
sweet will about these things, and simply will not voluntarily
open their mouths. Then it takes two persons to manage
them in the following manner: while one person holds the
child in his lap, its back and head braced against his chest
and the hands held down, the other person slides the handle
of a teaspoon along the tongue until he touches the soft palate;
this makes the child gag, and at that moment the tonsils are
brought plainly into view.</p>

<p>The treatment for tonsilitis should be prompt and active;
that is, when the disease is recognized, something should be
done at once to relieve it. If the bowels are constipated
give a laxative at once, and over the painful tonsils apply a
flaxseed poultice, keeping the neck and head wrapped up
well at the same time. For the fever give a dose of <i>antifebrine</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
in the forenoon and at bedtime; for a child one year old, one
grain for a dose; at the age of three or four, give two grains
at once, and at eight to twelve years, three grains can be
given. Chlorate of potassa is the best remedy for a gargle,
and for internal use also. Make a solution of chlorate of
potassa by dissolving one teaspoonful in a teacupful of hot
water, and when cooled off, have the child gargle every hour
or two, and swallow a half to a teaspoonful of the solution
at the same time.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Diphtheria of the throat is eminently an epidemic
disease and of a highly contagious and infectious nature.
Of late years, the disease occurs in every season of the year,
and independently of any epidemic or contagious influence,
but it is presumed that the contagion or spores are cultivated
in improper sanitary conditions arising from defective sewerage
and filthy accumulations. The disease invariably begins
with fever, a marked increase of the pulse, increase of
the temperature of the skin, and general depression. There
is first a difficulty of swallowing, a snuffling voice and stiffness
in the neck; the first two signs are due to the swelling
and diphtheritic coating of the tonsils, palate and nasal
passages, while the last symptom is due to a swelling of the
lymphatic glands of the neck which is never absent in genuine
diphtheria. If the throat is examined in the early
stage, the white membrane is first seen in the tonsils and as
the disease progresses it spreads to the palate, the pharynx
and the nasal passages. The color of the membrane also
changes; after several days it passes into a yellowish-white
or grayish-white tint. It has another peculiar feature that
distinguishes this membrane from the exudation of ordinary
tonsilitis, which the practical eye at once detects; the membrane
of diphtheria makes the impression of having eaten
into the tonsil or as though it was pressed into the tissue by
the finger. And that is really so too, because as a scientific
fact it is no membrane at all, but a death or slough of the
mucous membrane which may extend down into the tissue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
beneath the membrane. To treat diphtheria successfully
is simple enough but it requires great skill and experience,
and I will outline what I consider the proper thing to do
and which in my hands saved those lives that were intrusted
to my care.</p>

<p>The treatment resolves itself into perfect cleanliness or
disinfection, stimulating nourishment and internal medication.</p>

<p>Everything must be kept clean around the patient, and a
vessel must be provided, containing a little chloride of lime
into which he spits or hawks the phlegm from his throat.
The membrane or slough in the throat or nose must be thoroughly
disinfected and the only evidence that this has been
successfully accomplished is when all offensive odor has disappeared.
For this purpose as a local application I employ
the following preparation: Solution of subsulphate of iron
(Monsel’s solution) 3 drams, glycerine 5 drams; mix and
pour ten to twenty drops into a saucer and by means of a
camel’s hair brush apply to the diphtheritic membrane until
the character and odor of it is destroyed; this application
repeat every four hours. Should the nasal passages be also
affected mix a teaspoonful of the preparation to a teacupful
of warm water and by means of a syringe wash the
nasal passages out several times a day. Give the patient
internal medicine to disinfect the stomach and for its alterative
action on the blood: for this purpose use tincture of
iron 4 drams, simple syrup, add to make 4 ounces. To a
child seven to ten years old give a teaspoonful, ten or fifteen
minutes each time, after the brushing. Between the times
of brushing and giving the medicine, that is two hours
afterwards, give the nourishment and stimulant; this consists
of milk punch. A child seven to ten years old should take
no less than a tablespoonful of whisky, with or without a little
sugar, in a half to a teacupful of milk beaten thoroughly
together with an egg beater; this is to be taken for a meal and
drank at once, and repeated every four hours. No other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
food or nourishment must be given for a number of days,
and if the child is thirsty between times allow it to drink
sweetened water and whisky. Sometimes the glands of the
neck and the tonsils swell and become very painful; for this
the Belladonna ointment applied with gentle friction night
and morning and the neck enveloped in cotton batting are
certain to give relief. The efficiency of this treatment depends
upon the intelligence and faithfulness with which it
is used.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Croup is a term derived from the German Kropf
the crop or craw of the bird; this disease is known by a
great many different names, but on account of its shortness,
<i>croup</i> has received the preference. The disease has to do
with an affection of the organ of the voice, the <i>larynx</i>, which
is the upper part of the air passage, and situated between
the trachea and base of the tongue at the upper and front
part of the neck where it forms a projection in the middle
line which is prominent above and called the pomum
Adami or Adam’s apple. The larynx contains the vocal
cords, running from before backwards on both sides; these
form the narrow fissure or chink, the <i>rima glottidis</i>, through
which we breathe. Like all other air passages this too is
lined with mucous membrane. The symptoms that foreshadow
croup are not particularly significant, for they simply
indicate that the child has a cold. The children have
a cough, they sneeze, and their appetite is capricious for a
few days; they are not as lively as usual and are more or
less feverish. In a certain proportion of cases there is
nothing noticeable before the croup develops, for the children
may go to bed perfectly well and sleep calmly the first
few hours of the night, when suddenly they are awakened
with a barking cough, which greatly frightens young children
and they begin to cry. The cough may repeat itself
at short intervals, the voice become hoarse and husky and
lower and lower, so that in the morning a well marked
croup is developed. The voice finally disappears so completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
that it is not heard above a whisper, and the greatest
pain and harassing symptoms of suffocation do not enable
the child to utter a loud sound. The respiration becomes
labored in proportion to the swelling of the vocal cords and
other obstructions to the passage of air through the larynx.
Croup has vagaries that cannot be foretold. One child may
have symptoms of so threatening a nature that one believes
it will suffocate at any moment, yet, with a few simple remedies,
the symptoms will gradually lessen and it recovers in
a few days, while another may be suffering comparatively
little and from appearances one would imagine that there is
little or no danger, but at once it will change and grow
worse so rapidly that it will die in a few hours. For this
simple reason no case of croup should be carelessly or lightly
considered. When a child has croup it should be put at
once into a warm room; a big fire should be kept up, and
the child given hot drinks or a cupful of hot tea so as to
make it sweat. The front part of the neck should be rubbed
with equal parts of turpentine and sweet oil until it feels
warm and the skin reddens. If the child has eaten a good
supper, a teaspoonful of syrup of ipecac should be given
every half hour until it vomits; otherwise vomiting should be
omitted. The following mixture always gives relief and
with other precautions is all that is usually required.</p>

<p>Mix and give half to one teaspoonful every two hours

<p>What we have considered thus far is also called spasmodic,
catarrhal or <i>false</i> croup, to distinguish it from another variety
that is described under the name of <i>membranous</i> or diphtheritic
croup.</p>

<p>This form of croup as its name indicates is characterized
by a membrane which forms upon the surface of the inflamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
mucous membrane of the larynx as an exudation,
and sometimes the croupous membrane extends down into
the windpipe or trachea.</p>

<p>This variety of croup begins just like the simple or
catarrhal form only as the disease progresses the symptoms
gradually grow worse, and remain persistent. It is fortunately
a very rare disease and almost always fatal when it does
occur. An ordinary or catarrhal croup may, when neglected,
run into the membranous form and for that reason children
who are croupous, no matter how light it may appear, should
be carefully nursed until the symptoms have passed off.
The treatment for membranous croup has been on the whole
very unsatisfactory; the membrane which forms in the
larynx and windpipe is the cause of suffocating the child,
and the question how to remove this has never as yet been
answered. Of course a great many remedies have been
suggested and used but at times all have disappointed. The
successful case of membranous croup that I treated many
years ago was cured by giving the little patient inhalations
of lime water with a steam atomizer and besides giving
whisky and milk as nourishment; how much of the success
in this case was due to the child’s vigorous constitution and
how much to the treatment will always remain a mystery.
In the commencement, the same treatment that was recommended
for false croup is advisable; later on the skill of a
good physician is required.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) Bronchitis or catarrh of the bronchial tubes is generally
the cause of the ordinary cough due to exposure or
taking cold. Its danger depends upon the severity of the
bronchial inflammation and upon the age of the patient;
the younger the child the more dangerous the disease. In
older children or adults there is no connection between a
bronchitis and a pneumonia, but in infants or children under
two years of age who are suffering from bronchitis the
tendency toward a complication with pneumonia is ever
present; in fact, in children of this age, pneumonia usually
begins in that way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Cough is the most prominent symptom and it is always
present from the commencement of the affection, and apprehensive
of this the parents seek medical assistance. The
expectoration in young children is generally swallowed after
each paroxysm of cough, hence the nature of it can rarely
be seen. In the first part of the night the cough is always
more severe than during the day, and the paroxysms may
last from half to one minute, recurring several times in the
hour. Some children are less disturbed in their sleep than
others, for they sleep on, notwithstanding the cough, while
others always awaken, become annoyed from the disturbance
and cry. These interruptions in their night’s rest reduce
them in strength and flesh. Children who cough more
when laid on one or the other side than when they lie on
their back and who distort their face when coughing or, when
old enough, complain of pain during or after coughing have
something more than a simple bronchitis; they have a complication
of pleurisy or a pneumonia. There is always fever
and this may run very high, so that the child becomes delirious;
even before the fever becomes very pronounced or the
cough very annoying, their little hands and faces feel hot to
the touch, indicating that they are not well.</p>

<p>Infants require good nursing when they are suffering
from bronchitis, and it is not good to let them lie on their
backs all of the time; when they have a coughing spell take
them up quickly and lay them across the knees, with their
faces downwards; this gives the mucus a chance to run out
of the bronchial tubes and mouth which is better than
swallowing it. The most important feature in the treatment
of bronchitis is a warm room of even temperature night and
day. If the temperature is allowed to go down during the
night and the child inhales cold air into the lungs it will
often bring on a relapse or aggravate the disease. When
children have a cough and cold they must be kept warm in
order to get well; this is no time for trying to harden them.
A thermometer should be in every house and certainly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
every bedchamber, so that the temperature of a room may
be gauged to a certainty. In ordinary cases the temperature
should not fall below seventy degrees Fahrenheit, and when
the child coughs very much and the bronchitis is very bad
it is best to keep the temperature of the room around eighty
degrees night and day for several days, and as the patient improves,
it is advisable to gradually drop to seventy.</p>

<p>The application of oil and spirits of turpentine is advisable
in all cases of cold in the chest; it does good and one
can hardly explain how and why. For the cough an infant
can take with great advantage three or four drops of syrup
of ipecac together with the same amount of paregoric,
every four hours; older children take larger doses in proportion.
When scrofula or tuberculosis is at the bottom of the
bronchitis, a reliable preparation of cod liver oil emulsion
should also be administered.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) Pneumonia is the technical term for inflammation of
the lungs or <i>lung fever</i>. It consists of an inflammation,
involving the air cells and smallest air tubules of the lungs;
in other words, it is an inflammation of the substance or
tissues of the lungs.</p>

<p>It is altogether a more serious affection than bronchitis,
and in very small children exceedingly dangerous. The
inflammation may affect either a small circumscribed portion
of the lung, <i>lobular</i> pneumonia, or it may compromise
an entire lobe or all the lobes of the lung, and is then
called <i>lobar</i> pneumonia. Pneumonia is dangerous in proportion
to the extent of lung tissue involved and the symptoms
become correspondingly aggravated. The disease occurs
extremely often in children, but it is altogether different
from that which occurs in the adult. In children it is of a
bronchial nature, that is, the ordinary bronchial catarrh
has a tendency to extend to the very small bronchial tubes
(capillary bronchitis), thence into the air cells of the lungs.
In this variety of pneumonia the lungs do not become inflamed
in their entirety, but here and there patches of lung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
tissue become the seat of lobular pneumonia. In the nursling,
catarrhal pneumonia is an extremely frequent affection
and I believe that it is principally due to the carelessness
and promiscuous bathing of infants to which I have already
referred. In foundling hospitals this disease destroys a great
many children, and the chief cause has been attributed to
their lying both night and day in a horizontal posture.</p>

<p>It has been statistically proven that many more children
suffer from the disease in winter than in summer, and
further, that in those parts of the lung that are inflamed the
bronchial tubes which lead to them are also found to be inflamed.
This relation of catarrhal pneumonia to bronchitis
may be accounted for by the play of a mechanical force and
thus illustrates the relation of cause and effect. The secretion
of bronchitis not being expectorated, gravitates into the
region in which the inflamed bronchial tubes terminate,
namely, the air cells of the lungs, and by irritating and blocking
or filling the air cells, a catarrhal pneumonia is developed.</p>

<p>The symptoms of pneumonia in children under two years
of age are those of the catarrhal or lobular type; after they
have passed through their first dentition they become subject
to lobar pneumonia which differs in no particular from the
disease which occurs in grown persons. Practice and experience
make the discovery of catarrhal pneumonia possible in
little children as soon as they are under observation for a
little while. The most prominent sign is the rapidity of the
respiration, which rises to sixty and eighty per minute instead
of forty-four, the average normal respiration for the
first year of infantile life.</p>

<p>The disease begins with a cough and more or less fever,
and as it is always preceded with bronchitis, the symptoms
that were enumerated when speaking of the latter disease are
equally applicable to this one. Later on, when the transition
of bronchial catarrh into pneumonia takes place, all the
symptoms become at once aggravated. The breathing, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
instance, becomes labored and increases and the nostrils
dilate with each inspiration. The mouth is open, and its
corners are drawn downward and outward, depicting distress
and suffering, while the eyes roll anxiously about or
become glassy and staring.</p>

<p>The treatment of pneumonia in its early stages would be
the treatment of bronchitis, since every pneumonia in young
children is preceded by a bronchial catarrh. The uniform
temperature is of the first importance. The same remedy
that was suggested for the cough in bronchitis is also here
serviceable.</p>

<p>A systematic course of nourishment must form a part of
every successful treatment for pneumonia; and as an old
medical friend once told me in a consultation “<i>if the child is
kept alive long enough with nourishment it is bound to get well</i>.”
In critical cases it is surprising the large amount of whisky
a little infant consumes with avidity; its eyes begging and
watchingly following the teaspoon from the cup to its mouth.
I attended my own child once when only three months old and
although there seemed no hope, for its tiny finger tips were
blue and its lips livid from deficient aeration, yet it eagerly
took its teaspoonful of whisky toddy every fifteen minutes
through the longest part of the night, and towards morning
it took a change for the better and its life was saved. I also
believe that these babies must be kept in a constant sweat;
this relieves the congestion of the lungs. The nourishment
must be given at regular intervals of several hours just as
you would give medicine, for indeed it is a medicine at this
time.</p>

<p>Another valuable agent to which I attribute a number of
recoveries is the application of a moist girdle suggested by
Professor Alfred Vogel, of the University of Dorpat, Russia.
In his work on “Diseases of Children” he says: “A diaper, or
large white pocket handkerchief is folded up like a cravat; the
bandage thus obtained should be three or four fingers wide,
and the whole length of the handkerchief. This is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
dipped in warm water, and wrung out so that the cloth does
not drip, and then applied like a girdle around the chest of
the child. A second cloth, double the size of the first, is
folded up in the same manner like it, but which must be six
to eight fingers broad, and then applied dry and warm over
the first. It is very advisable to interpose a piece of gutta
percha or oil silk between the dry and the wet girdle by
which on the one hand, the moistness of the first cloth is
preserved longer, while on the other, the second does not
become wet. If the water with which the fomentations are
made is not too cold, the child will tolerate them very well
and in a short time, a slight retardation in frequency and
improvement of the respiration are indicated by less motion
of the nostrils. These warm compresses should be continued
for from four to six days, and it is not at all necessary, during
the entire time, to remove the bandage; the oil silk is
raised up a little, and a few teaspoonfuls of water are poured
upon the girdle or it is moistened with a sponge. The principal
thing is not to allow a cooling of the skin by evaporation
to take place. To secure this object, the dry cloth
should properly overlap the moist one on all sides and as it
is impossible to prevent the upper cloth from becoming wet,
it should be changed several times during the day. I certainly
have applied this girdle many hundreds of times, and
have very often seen rapid improvement ensue; nevertheless,
it cannot be denied that the half of these children perish
notwithstanding. If cold compresses are applied the
children cry of fright in consequence, and the symptoms become
worse until the cold water has become warm.” The
application of blisters, cupping or leeching should not be
tolerated.</p>

<p class="pch">DISEASES PECULIAR TO CHILDREN&mdash;<span class="smcap">Continued</span>.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <span class="smcap">Indigestion</span> in very young children is generally
accompanied with diarrhœa, because that portion of the
child’s food which is not thrown up or digested passes along
the intestinal canal and acting as an irritant causes diarrhœa.
An indigestion of only a short period of duration excites a
catarrhal inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
stomach, and this may be so slight that even a change or
correction in the diet may be all that is required to relieve
it. Children who are suffering from indigestion have stomach
ache; this may be continuous or come on half an hour
or an hour after nursing. The pain is due to the irritation
caused by the nutriment or to the fermentation of the food
and the consequent accumulation of gas within the stomach.
The stomach becomes distended and sensitive to pressure.
When the catarrh is severe the nutriment that the child
takes into the stomach is immediately rejected or it may
vomit glairy or greenish mucus from an empty stomach.
At first the nutrition of the child may not be greatly interfered
with, for some of the food is retained and digested in
the small intestines, but in the course of time these too become
irritated and then diarrhœa complicates the case and
the child falls off and becomes rapidly emaciated. Children
who are nourished from their mother’s breasts rarely suffer
from indigestion, but those who are fed on artificial foods
become victims of stomach and bowel troubles. And for
this reason it is natural to suppose that the chief reliance for
a successful treatment is to regulate and study the diet of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
sufferer; the chapter that is especially devoted to this subject
should be consulted for further information.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Diarrhœa is a derangement of the stools in which
they loose their semi-solid, pap-like consistence and become
watery liquid alone, or watery liquid in which indigested
particles of food and fecal matter remain suspended. The
quantity of alvine matter that is evacuated greatly exceeds
that which passes in the normal state. The stools have an
alkaline or acrid nature which irritates and often inflames
the anus and the surrounding integument. “The normal
form of the infantile feces in the first year of life is the
pappy; the color is yellow like that of the yolk of egg; the
smell is feebly acid, never putrid, and only in children who
are fed upon a meat diet as repulsively pungent as in the
adult; in later years they are no longer distinguished from
the adult.”</p>

<p>The passages of diarrhœa may be simply softer, but yellowish
and increased in quantity, or they may be bright
yellow and so watery as to squeeze out from the anus as
from a syringe and soak through diapers and bedclothes,
or the stools may be green, or bilious, and slimy. When
children teethe they often have a diarrhœa for several days;
this intestinal derangement has no connection with improper
feeding, yet it requires to be watched lest it become serious
and uncontrollable. There is still another kind of diarrhœa
which is foamy and contains large quantities of mucus and
little or no coloring matter. For the different varieties one
and the same remedy will answer, and that which I here
submit has never disappointed my expectation:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Dysentery or Flux is an inflammation of the mucous
membrane of the large intestine, or colon, extending
down to the rectum. Children under one year of age are
not as liable to this affection as those who are older, and it
is during their first dentition that the affection shows itself.
In hot summer months, at the season of unripe fruits, the
disease often becomes epidemic. The loss of strength and
flesh is very rapid, and when children do not perish during
the first few days of their sickness, they may succumb later
when the disease has assumed a chronic form. Dysentery
is extremely liable to become complicated with pneumonia,
anæmia, pyæmia, perforations and strictures of the intestines,
jaundice and abscess of the liver, and in proportion
that these complications become developed life becomes seriously
threatened. The symptoms of dysentery are striking
and can hardly be mistaken for anything else. There is
always pain over the abdomen, but on touching the abdomen
near the navel and over the course of the colon the pain is
greater than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Tenesmus is a characteristic symptom of dysentery.
This is a straining sensation as if the bowels wanted to
move, yet notwithstanding the violent bearing down, only
a little mucus often streaked with pus or blood is discharged.
The straining causes the lower folds of the rectum to protrude,
and this portion of the bowel presents a livid red color; the
sufferer is tormented a great deal by this fruitless bearing
down, and the bowels should be anointed with pure zinc
ointment and returned. The stools of the child are characteristic
of this disease. Every passage contains glairy mucus
formed into lumps resembling granules of boiled starch,
streaked with blood and associated with a creamy looking
substance which is purulent matter. If the disease has
progressed to the formation of ulcers the evacuations become
grayish red or assume a dirty ashen color, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
odor is putrescent. Portions of the mucous membrane
slough off and large quantities of pus are discharged from
the ulcerating surfaces so that the stools present sometimes
nothing but purulent and bloody matter.</p>

<p>The treatment for this disease must be prompt and directed
to the point; reliance must not be placed upon one
single remedy, but a combination of expedients must be resorted
to.</p>

<p>The greatest annoyance and source of pain is the straining
and tenesmus, and to relieve this steps must at once be
taken. There is hardly any use to give injections for this
purpose for the irritable condition of the rectum makes it
impossible for the child to retain them long enough to do
any good. Use suppositories instead, and if need be, retain
them by holding a soft compress of cloth over the anus, for
ten to fifteen minutes until they are dissolved. For example,
to a child one year old I employ the following suppository:&mdash;</p>

<table id="tt11f" summary="tt11f">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdr">Take:</td>
  <td class="tdl">Laudanum</td>

 </tr>

</table>

<p>Make into one long suppository and roll in powdered bismuth,
dip it first into oil or vaseline and insert into the rectum
every three or four hours until the soreness and straining
have subsided. If the child is not very sensitive nor very
ill an injection of a teaspoonful of boiled liquid starch to
which a few drops of laudanum have been added, may be
used instead and as often as may be necessary. Cold drinks
aggravate the pains, therefore give everything warm.</p>

<p>Cow’s milk should be dispensed with in artificially fed
children, and broths substituted to which a portion of a fresh
egg is added, previously thoroughly beaten with an egg beater;
in very young children the yolk alone should be used. A little
whisky is always good for this class of patients, either in
their broth, or given as a toddy in teaspoonful doses for the
children are generally always thirsty and feverish. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
children lose their appetites and refuse nourishment they
must be coaxed and even forced to take food at regular
intervals, otherwise they cannot rally and will perish from
inanition. The medicine that I recommended for diarrhœa
is also very useful for dysentery.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Colic is the result of an abnormal accumulation of
gas, <i>flatulency</i>, in the small intestine. There is always more
or less gas in both stomach and bowels, but usually this
passes off and there is no pain felt from it. It is when the
quantity increases so as to distend the bowels that the walls
of the intestines become the seat of pain. The pain comes
on in paroxysms, or fits at short intervals, and increasing in
violence. Children suffering from colic have the abdomen
swollen or bloated, giving rise to that condition termed
meteorismus or tympanites. Those who are under one year
old are the most liable to colicky pains, for it is during this
period of life that digestive disturbances are the most
frequent, and these constitute the chief cause. Whenever
the vermicular motion of the intestines becomes lessened or
suspended, the gas is not expelled from the anus, and the
accumulation causes the characteristic pains under consideration.
In perfectly healthy digestion there is always more
or less gas developed, and even then there may be colicky
pains. The same pains originate with every diarrhœa that
is due to improper food or feeding, and in dysentery too they
are generally present. Infants who nurse at their mother’s
breasts are less liable, but not altogether exempt, for mothers’
milk is very sensitive to impressions of purely physical
exertions, or to emotions of fear or fright, thus her milk may
become unhealthy for her child; or through her own digestion,
suffering from temporary or permanent derangement,
her milk may transmit a similar condition to her child; the
mother may have eaten green fruit, or too much of a variety,
or it may be too highly seasoned, or too fatty. Many mothers
and nurses look upon the colic cry as a hunger cry, and
hasten to feed the little one, and sometimes a few teaspoonfuls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
of milk or broth will relieve the cry for a few minutes,
then the pain returns severer than ever, and the baby cries
louder than ever. I have seen very nervous children thrown
into convulsions from severe colicky pains.</p>

<p>My rule has been for years to nurse infants for the first
two months not oftener than once in two hours; after that
until they are six months old, every three hours, and from
six to twelve months every four hours; between times the
babies cry, of course, not because they are hungry, but
because they have either pain or are thirsty. The old German
household remedy for this is <i>fennel seed tea</i>; there is nothing
as useful; it expels the gas and it quenches the thirst
from which colicky children suffer, at least while they have
the colic. This tea should be given regularly between
times, and until they are twelve or fifteen months old; it is
soothing, and what is of equal importance, it prevents overfeeding,
which is the bane of artificially-fed children. The
latter, bottle-fed babies, are all more or less colicky, and for
these the fennel seed tea, between bottle time is indeed a balm.
If the fennel seed tea does not relieve the child at once, or if
the pain seems severe, then add a few drops of paregoric to
the fennel seed tea, and give an injection of German chamomile
tea, rubbing the bowels at the same time with a mixture
of turpentine and sweet oil, and I believe that every case
will be relieved. Permanent relief must be sought in ferreting
out the cause and removing it. This may be due to
improper food, or feeding, to indigestible contents in the
stomach or bowels, and indeed, very often to constipation.
When the stomach is overloaded, a dose of syrup of ipecac
may give relief, and if due to constipation, the Femina
laxative syrup is the most appropriate remedy.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Convulsions, or spasms in children have long been
well known to the laity, and from their frequent occurrence
they make an important class of children’s diseases. If
there is one thing more frightful to behold than another, to
the young and inexperienced mother, it is to see her baby’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
eyes unsteadily rolling, or turned up so as to show only the
white of the eyeballs, or may be the eyes steadily fixed in
a stare while the child becomes completely unconscious. A
painful smile may play over its face, or an expression of
fear or anger may distort the facial expression, while the
muscles of the face twitch convulsively. The jaws are
sometimes set, then again there is gnashing of the teeth,
alternating with relaxation of muscles and ligaments. The
child cannot swallow, and fluids poured into the mouth flow
out again. The other muscles of the body also participate in
the spasmodic contractions; those of the back contract and
relax, and those of the extremities are involved in lively
twitchings, or perform acts of thrashing, striking or twisting.
The breathing becomes very irregular, and from the
spasms of the muscles of the larynx or throat it may
become entirely suspended, and if the spasm does not subside
in two or three minutes the child may die. The skin
becomes livid or congested and loses its sensibility so that
blisters or irritants make no painful impression. Sometimes
the child bleeds from the nose or mouth; the latter is
generally due to the tongue having been caught between
the teeth during the paroxysm. Frothy saliva wells up
from the mouth and the urine and stools are involuntarily
discharged.</p>

<p>All convulsive attacks have not every symptom above
enumerated, some of them are usually absent and an attack
may be quite mild, and last only a few moments; if convulsions
last longer they are not only dangerous, but indicate
serious disease, either of the brain or in which the brain or
spinal cord is seriously complicated.</p>

<p>The period of the child’s life at which convulsions are
most frequent is from the time they are born up to the completion
of the first dentition. Nervous children who had
convulsions while they were teething are susceptible to violent
attacks at the commencement of various diseases or
during the developmental stage of the eruptive fevers. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the most frequent cause of convulsions in children is
the eruption of teeth. The irritation which a growing tooth
causes in the gums also irritates its nerve and this irritability
is reflected on the brain, and this causes the spasm. An
overloaded stomach, worms and digestive disturbances that
accompany teething irritate the bowels and from this too
convulsions ensue. The treatment for convulsions naturally
resolves itself into first giving instant relief during the paroxysm,
and secondly, finding out the cause of the attack.
The latter is not always easy at first sight, and as the cause
may be serious a competent physician should be sent for.
But instructions that are serviceable while the convulsion is
on are of the greatest importance to mother and child. The
old and familiar remedy of giving the child a hot bath as
soon as possible is certainly the best thing that can be done.
The child should be undressed as quickly as possible so as
to relieve it from all constriction and so that nothing can interfere
with the respiration and circulation.</p>

<p>A towel wrung out of cold water should be placed over
the child’s head and its body immersed in hot water that is
not so hot as to scald; the hands on which the child is supported
while in the water must be well able to stand the
heat. When the spasm has subsided, the child should be
transferred to a previously warmed woolen blanket in which
it is to be wrapped with its head softly elevated. If the
bowels are constipated an enema of warm water and a little
castile soap should be administered.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Worms of different species infest the human organism;
they get into the system from the outside world, with
the food we eat and drink. Their abiding place seems to be
the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal with the exception
of the <i>trichinæ</i> which penetrate the mucous membrane
and make their way to the different muscles throughout
the body; the voluntary muscles seem to be their permanent
dwelling place. These parasites are peculiar to the meat of
the hog and as very young children do not eat this meat,
they are so far totally exempt from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>Tapeworms are rarely found in children under one
year of age; it is when they get older and especially when
they eat hog’s meat, for this too is the home of the embryo
tapeworm, that they become infected.</p>

<p>The roundworm, however, is peculiar to childhood. It
is a yellowish or whitish worm resembling the earthworm,
from one to twelve inches in length. The body is round,
tapering toward each extremity. This worm inhabits the
small intestine, but by acts of vomiting they are frequently
ejected from the mouth or they may find their way into
other cavities. On the Pacific slope these worms are not as
frequently met with as on the other side of the Rockies. It
is propagated by <i>ova</i> and taken into the system by means of
drinking water containing them. The number varies greatly
in different cases; sometimes there are only a few and again
there may be dozens or hundreds coiled together so as to
form balls or masses. They are most common between the
ages of three and ten years. I do not believe that they ever
exist in early infancy.</p>

<p>The symptoms denoting the presence of these parasites
are on the whole obscure and depend somewhat on the temperament
of the individual. A nervous child may be thrown
into fits or convulsions from them. My first case of these
worms in a child seven years old was rather exceptional and
remarkable. The child was suddenly taken with a severe
attack of spasmodic croup, for which I prescribed remedies
without much relief. After the second day the child passed
five large roundworms, the croup subsided, and while I
claimed no credit that my remedies did not cure the croup
it was generally conceded that they killed the worms.</p>

<p>The usual symptoms are colic pains, impaired appetite,
diarrhœa, itching of the nose, swollen abdomen, puffy features,
offensive odor of breath, dreaming sleep and grinding
the teeth during sleep or twitching of the muscles.</p>

<p>The expulsion of the parasite is generally effected with
simple remedies. Five to ten drops of spirits of turpentine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
in half to one tablespoonful of castor oil is a reliable remedy.
The oil of wormseed is another convenient remedy in the
same dose on a lump of sugar or mixed with oil; a cupful of
tansy tea early three or four mornings on an empty stomach
serves a useful purpose; pinkroot and senna administered as
a tea has also a well-deserved popularity.</p>

<p>The thread, pin, spring or mawworm inhabits the large
intestine and chiefly the rectum. It is a thin yellowish-white
parasite from one-twelfth to one-third inch in length;
the female has a straight, awl-like, pointed tail, the male has
a strongly curved tail. It rarely, if ever, enters the small
intestines. The worms occur chiefly in young children, but
there is no period of life that is exempt from them. They
cause pain and an itching sensation at the anus. This is
particularly troublesome when the children lie in warm beds.
The sexual organs are apt to become excited from the irritation
and the habit of masturbation be thus formed. In girls
the worms may travel into the vagina and leucorrhœa in
children is often accounted for in this way; around the anus
there may be pimply redness.</p>

<p>From the loss of appetite and sleep the general health of
the child may become impaired; but the only possible evidence
of the presence of worms is to examine the stools. If
worms of the above description cannot be seen, yet the symptoms
make their existence suspected, a dose of some of the
remedies above suggested should be given and afterwards
the stools again examined. Some children have a peculiar
predisposition to pinworms, and although you seem to give
them relief for the time being, in a short time afterwards the
same symptoms return and the worms are as numerous as
ever. In these cases a course of continual treatment becomes
necessary to eradicate the morbid habit; for this course I
recommend:</p>

<p>Mix and give half to one teaspoonful every night at bedtime.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Constipation is the bane of artificially reared children
and if the sagacity of mother or nurse does not correct the
evil it often causes serious complications. Sometimes those
who are nursed on the breast suffer from constipation, especially
when the mothers or wet nurses are troubled with similar
derangements. Children under one year of age should
have two evacuations, and those from one to three years
should have at least one passage a day; when this does not
occur the feces become solid and constipation is the result.
In most febrile affections constipation is caused by a loss of
moisture through the skin and an increased urinary secretion.
Certain foods constipate, especially the starchy or
farinaceous variety, as soups containing corn starch, rice,
sago, etc., and in older children certain dishes consisting of
peas, beans, and wheaten bread. A great many medicines
are constipating, for instance, most cough mixtures, for they
contain opium in some form, also preparations of iron, lead,
alum, bismuth, chalk, and vegetable remedies that contain
astringents or tannin.</p>

<p>It must be laid down as a <span class="smcap">RULE</span> never to be violated,
that every child must have at least one passage a day from
the day it is born, and it is the imperative duty of mother
or nurse to see that it is accomplished. The infant of only
a few days or weeks old may require only a few drops of
olive oil, but if that delays in its effect it may become necessary
to give relief at once, and for this purpose we have in
a small warm water enema a most decided and effectual
remedy. Soapsuds should never be used, except in very
urgent cases, for I have known a diarrhoea to ensue from the
irritation it caused which was very hard to control. If the
feces are not very hard a soap suppository may be used with
good advantage, and in the following manner: Take a piece
of soap and pare it to a point the thickness of a lead
pencil and about an inch long, moisten this and introduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
carefully into the rectum; if the straining bring only the
soap away it may be well to use the water enema afterward.
If the constipation continues to be habitual a slight modification
of the diet becomes necessary; starchy foods must
not be given as often, and thinner than formerly; the milk
too should be more diluted; broth or beef tea substituted
once or twice each day will often have a good effect. When
children are old enough to eat mixed food the diet can often
be so regulated as to materially contribute towards opening
the bowels. The children should be encouraged to drink a
great deal of water; from the lack of that alone some children
become constipated. Graham bread and boiled German
prunes are especially to be recommended; so are ripe
raw fruits, grapes, strawberries, apples, pears, etc. Children
require fresh air and outdoor exercise to be well and robust;
they run and jump more when in the open air, all of which
gives tone and strength to the general system. If diet and
outdoor exercise alone does not remedy the evil, then the
Femina laxative syrup should be administered; it is efficient
in its action, and pleasant to take, and unlike most
laxative or aperient remedies, there is no danger of forming
a habit of using purgatives.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) Whooping cough is the name of an affection deriving
its significance from a characteristic which is peculiar
to this cough. It commences like an ordinary bronchitis
such as is the result of taking cold; there is the usual hoarseness,
tickling in the throat, dry cough, sneezing, running from
the nose; the eyes are red and watery, and there is more or less
fever. Sometimes the cough is ordinary, but at other times
it has a sharp metallic clang from the beginning. Owing
to certain marked periods in the course of the affection it
has been found convenient to divide it into three stages
which may usually be distinguished, although in a certain
proportion of cases the first stage (comprising some of
the symptoms that have been enumerated above) may be
submerged into the second or whooping stage. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
stage may last from four to five days to as many weeks.
The second stage is when the peculiar sound or whoop
begins; it consists of a great number of violent paroxysms,
rapidly-recurring spasmodic coughs, until most of the air in
the lungs is expired; there is then a sense of suffocation and
the child becomes bluish red over the entire head and face,
from which the German designation <i>blue cough</i> has originated.
During this spell the face swells and the eyeballs become
congested and bulge from their orbits and the nose often begins
to bleed, while the urine and feces are often involuntarily
ejected and the contents of the stomach thrown up
from the violent contraction of the diaphragm. In a few
moments the spell is broken by a protracted, whistling
croupy inspiration, and this constitutes the whoop.</p>

<p>The whooping generally grows worse the first two or
three weeks, after which time in favorable cases the cough
gradually becomes milder, but this is not the rule by any
means. I have had it in my own family to last, in two instances,
six months, and in another eight months before the
children had fully recovered.</p>

<p>Laughing or crying, swallowing dry, irritating morsels
of food or cold and impure air will bring on a paroxysm of
cough. When several children are affected together, the
coughing of one will make the others cough.</p>

<p>The third stage is when the cough is wearing off and has
lost its severity. The expectoration consists now of a yellowish
or green-colored mucus; in otherwise healthy children
this lasts only a few weeks, but in weakly or scrofulous
ones it may last for several months. This disease is not as yet
thoroughly understood. It is an epidemic, contagious bronchial
catarrh, involving the nerves of respiration and attacks
an individual but once. When complications arise the
affection becomes exceedingly dangerous and the most common
of these is pneumonia.</p>

<p>There is no specific cure for whooping cough; it has got
to run its course, which may be either short or long. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
tried every agent so far known to scientific medicine, and there
is none that will give prompt relief in every instance. Whooping
cough being a bronchitis plus something else, it seems
rational that the same precautions that are observed in a case
of bronchitis should be followed here. Children with this
affection must not be exposed to drafts or rough winds lest
they get cold, which might seriously complicate matters. In
summer when the weather is warm, outdoor life is beneficial
in hastening recovery. Some children have the cough so
light, that no extra precautions seem to be necessary; they
have no fever, eat, feel and sleep well. But those who are
feverish, who vomit freely, and whose appetite is capricious,
require every attention. Their diet should be especially
guarded, so that all dry, irritating nutriments are prohibited,
and so that the diet consists principally of liquid nourishment.
Warm drinks have a favorable influence on the disease; a
plentiful supply of warm milk, first thoroughly beaten with
an egg beater is the most suitable and convenient. The milk
punch is often borne well, and the little whisky that enters
into its composition is a needed stimulant to the sufferer;
broths may be given for a change, and to these the yolk of
an egg can be added with advantage. A great many remedies
might be suggested, but the one which has served my
purpose the best, is the following:</p>

<table id="tt11g" summary="tt11g">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdr">Take:</td>
  <td class="tdl">Deodorized tincture, of opium</td>
  <td class="tdr">½ dram</td>

 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdl">Simple syrup</td>
  <td class="tdr">2 ounces</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>For a child five years old, give a teaspoonful three or
four times a day; older or younger children in proportion.
If the cough is hard and dry, ten to twenty drops of syrup
of ipecac alone should be given instead of the mixture, and
when the cough is loosened, the mixture can be again administered.
When in the course of the affection the breathing
suddenly becomes labored, and the fever increases, it is fair
to presume that the case is complicated with pneumonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) Eruptive fevers, as their name implies, are characterized
by an eruption or exanthema. The most virulent
of this class is smallpox. The eruption of this disease is of
the nature of vesicles, or pustules, while that of measles,
scarlatina, and rose rash is dry, and is properly called a <i>rash</i>.
Chickenpox, however, has also vesicles and pustules, and
for this reason it is very liable in times of an epidemic of
smallpox to be mistaken for a mild form of the latter disease.
For obvious reasons it is not proper to consider smallpox
in this connection; its gravity and its management
require experience, and further, it generally comes under
special quarantine regulations of the proper constituted
authorities.</p>

<p>The eruptive fevers are all divided into three stages,
namely: a stage of invasion or development; a second
stage when the eruption appears, and while it lasts; and
a third stage, that of <i>desquamation</i>, when the eruption begins
to fade or exfoliate in branny scales.</p>

<p>(<i>j</i>) Measles is generally a mild and not serious disease,
and only attacks the individual but once in a lifetime; only
through gross carelessness the disease becomes complicated,
and then it may become a very dangerous affection. It
begins with all the symptoms of a common cold. There is
frequent sneezing, and an acrid muco-serous discharge from
the nostrils. The eyes are irritable, reddened and watery,
and there is more or less intolerance of light. The voice
becomes hoarse and there is always a bronchitis present
which is characterized by a dry, harsh cough. The patient
is generally feverish, alternating with chilly sensations or
shivering; the appetite is poor or absent and in some cases
there is nausea and vomiting. The children feel drowsy;
they complain of pain in the head and limbs and want to
lounge around. The bowels may be constipated, but diarrhœa
supervenes in a certain proportion of cases. In nervous
children convulsions may occur; bleeding from the nose
and false croup are not infrequently met with in the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
of this disease. The duration of the first stage varies
greatly in different individuals, and comprises a period
extending from one to seven days. The eruption begins
generally on the temples and forehead, whence it extends
over the head and neck, thence down the back and over the
entire body, occupying in its development from thirty-six to
forty-eight hours. The eruption bears a resemblance to flea
bites at first; it appears as minute red specks which gradually
enlarge and become slightly elevated and arrange themselves
in circular clusters. The portions of the skin that
are free from the eruption retain their white appearance; the
face is more or less swollen and the eyelids puffed. In some
patients there is considerable annoyance from itching in the
skin. The cough and bronchitis continue to be prominent
symptoms, and the expectoration, consisting of yellowish
sputa becomes abundant. In some children the fever runs
very high in this stage and they become delirious and restless,
but this is only temporary, for it generally diminishes
with the eruption on the third or fourth day.</p>

<p>When the eruption begins to fade the third stage of the
affection is inaugurated, and when there exist no complications,
the patient may now be considered on the way to
recovery which takes from four to eight days longer.</p>

<p>The treatment in measles should consist in good nursing,
rather than in medication. Owing to the inflammation of
the membranes of the eyes, the patient should be kept in a
darkened chamber, and the eyes occasionally bathed with a
solution of borax, by dissolving half a teaspoonful in a tumblerful
of water. Good judgment forbids that the patient
should be sweltered, but that he should be kept comfortably
warm and never allowed to cool off suddenly is also very
important. When the eruption is slow to develop a good
sweat will often bring it out; so will undue exposure, to cold
drafts and the transportation out of a warm bed into a cold
one or drinking immoderately of cold drinks either delay
the development of the eruption or drive it back, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
this undoubtedly dangerous complications arise, like pneumonia,
diphtheritic croup, and convulsions. A mouthful
of cold water now and then is harmless, but on the whole
the drinks should be quite warm; the cough and bronchitis
alone would require that.</p>

<p>Warm milk thoroughly beaten is the most suitable form
of diet; broths and soups may be given for a change, so can
a mixture of equal parts of weak hot tea and milk. The
bowels should be moved with a mild laxative and if the
fever runs very high, ten to fifteen drops of the sweet spirits
of nitre, for a child five years old, in half wineglass of water
every few hours will generally reduce the temperature. For
the itching, the skin should be rubbed with equal parts of
glycerine and warm water. The cough is generally the
most troublesome feature, and the only symptom requiring
regular medication; for this a good general cough mixture
will serve every purpose, such as:</p>

<table id="tt11h" summary="tt11h">

  <td class="tdr">Take:</td>
  <td class="tdl">Compound mixture of liquorice,</td>

 <tr>
  <td> </td>
  <td class="tdl">Syrup of wild cherry, of each</td>
  <td class="tdr">2 ounces</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>Mix and give to a child four years old a teaspoonful every
four hours; older or younger children in proportion.</p>

<p>(<i>k</i>) Rose rash, sometimes called false or German measles
is a comparatively trivial affection and of very little importance,
for it never has any serious complications and lasts
only twenty-four or forty-eight hours in the majority of cases.
It is often mistaken for measles, and one attack affords no
protection against recurrences. The eruption appears in
small rose-colored spots or patches which are not elevated.
It does not commence on the head, but appears on different
parts of the body. The eruption may be preceded by headache,
loss of appetite, occasionally vomiting, and more or
less fever or chilly sensations.</p>

<p>The affection of the eyes and air passages, especially
the bronchitis which is characteristic of measles, are wanting
in rose rash, and when we hear of children having had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
measles several times it is reasonable to presume that it was
rose rash instead. This eruption hardly calls for treatment,
but a mild laxative and a regulated diet would fulfill all
requirements.</p>

<p>(<i>l</i>) Scarlet fever or scarlatina has received its name from
the color of its eruption. This affection presents itself differently
in different cases. It may be so mild in its attack
that it constitutes a trifling ailment and again it may be so
severe that life is seriously threatened, and destroyed in a
few days. This has formed the basis of dividing scarlatina
into three varieties, namely: simple scarlatina, diphtheritic
scarlatina and malignant scarlatina.</p>

<p>The fever, as a rule, is notably higher than in other eruptive
fevers. The attack may begin with a chill, nausea and
vomiting and headache. There is also bleeding from the
nose in a certain proportion of cases. The most constant
sign is redness and more or less swelling of the throat, either
with or without a sense of soreness and pain in the act of
swallowing. The stage of development lasts in the average
twenty-four hours, although exceptionally it may appear in
a few hours after the first symptoms of the disease have appeared.
The eruption often begins on the back first, and
from there rapidly spreads over the entire body in twenty-four
hours. It greatly differs from the eruption in measles
in not allowing any healthy or white skin to intervene between
the red specks, but the entire skin has a reddish blush.
This has given rise to the expression <i>boiled lobster</i> appearance
in scarlatina, and indeed nothing could illustrate the color
of the skin better than by comparing the one with the other.
The eruption is sometimes accompanied with a great deal of
itching and burning and reaches its fullest development on
the third day after its first appearance; it lasts from four to
six days.</p>

<p>The extent and redness of the eruption varies greatly in
different individuals, in some it is very slight and transient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
while in others there is not a spot as large as a dime which
is not covered. Yet a very light attack in one patient when
communicated to another individual may develop in that
one a most malignant form. One attack secures against a
recurrence.</p>

<p>The throat affection seems to modify the eruption of the
skin for in some instances in which the throat is very bad,
the skin eruption is comparatively slight. There may be
simply a little redness over the tonsils, extending more or
less over the soft palate, or on the other hand, the disease in
the throat may become in every respect equal to if not identical
with the worst type of diphtheria. Some writers consider
the sore throat of scarlatina and that of diphtheria
identical, and from a practical point of view there is certainly
no difference, and the very best results are obtained when
all severe sore throats of scarlatina are treated precisely as if
they were diphtheria; this has always been my practice.</p>

<p>The tongue is quite distinctive of the affection; early in
the development of the disease it is generally furred, but
later the coating peels off in patches, and these spots present
the appearance of a ripe <i>strawberry</i>; sometimes the entire
surface of the tongue looks as if cayenne pepper or red sand
had been sprinkled on it.</p>

<p>The fever generally increases during the eruptive stage,
and the skin becomes very dry and hot. The pulse may
run up to 130 to 140 per minute, while the temperature runs
up as high as 106° Fahrenheit; this state of affairs places
the patient in imminent danger, he now may become restless
and even delirious. In a certain proportion of cases the kidneys
become involved and albuminuria is a result, but this
usually passes off with the improvement and recovery of the
patient.</p>

<p>In the third stage the cuticle begins to exfoliate in the
form of branny scales. In the absence of serious complications
this stage marks the beginning of convalescence; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
fever subsides, the appetite returns, and the soreness and
redness of the throat disappear.</p>

<p>The treatment of this affection always depends upon the
nature of the case. Simple scarlatina requires no medical
treatment; the precaution and intelligence which are comprised
in good nursing supply everything that is required.
There is not the same danger of the eruption striking in
with scarlatina as there is with measles, and the patient
need not be kept so warmly covered. When the fever runs
very high, sponging the surface with cool water is very
grateful and reduces the temperature. After the eruption
has thoroughly developed, the water for sponging off may
be very cold without the least danger, and this may be repeated
as often as comfort or the high temperature demands.
To relieve the burning and itching of the skin, the entire
body should be rubbed over with glycerine night and morning;
this relieves the system and makes the skin moist and supple.
If the throat is only reddened, a teaspoonful of chlorate
of potash dissolved in a cupful of hot water and when cold
used as a gargle and a teaspoonful of the solution swallowed
at the same time every two hours is all that is necessary.
The diphtheritic scarlatina is treated precisely similar to
and according to the instructions laid down for diphtheria
in another part of this work. Move the bowels freely with
the Femina laxative syrup.</p>

<p>(<i>m</i>) Chickenpox has neither distressing symptoms nor is
it significant as regards danger. It is an eruptive fever
which occasionally affects adults, but for the most part
children. The eruption is generally preceded by a slight
fever and nausea, and appears first on the body and afterwards
on the scalp where it is usually more abundant.
There always remains healthy white skin between the vesicles,
which at first contain a transparent liquid, hence called
by the Germans waterpox, which afterward becomes cloudy
or opaline. The eruption begins to dry up from the fifth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
the seventh day forming granular crusts that are sometimes
followed by pitting. The disease is contagious and develops
twelve to seventeen days after the exposure. Chickenpox
claims no treatment; its only point of interest is its resemblance
to varioloid, but as a successful vaccination guarantees
against the latter, and as the vesicles of varioloid have
a central depression while those of chickenpox have not, the
individuality of the affection is readily established.</p>

<p class="pch">EMERGENCY TREATMENT IN SUDDEN ACCIDENTS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the author reviews his experience of the last twenty
years, he recalls to memory innumerable instances in which
the lack of a little special knowledge, in cases of sudden accidents,
did not only incur useless physical suffering, but
cost lives which otherwise might have been saved. Knowledge
of this nature is not intuitive, but must be acquired
by study. He therefore offers for the guidance of the
intelligent reader, common sense advice on the immediate
management of accidents which are liable to occur at almost
any moment.</p>

<p>If a child falls any considerable distance to the ground,
the system receives a shock varying from the slightest functional
disturbance to complete insensibility.</p>

<p>In the former case there may probably be only slight
pallor of the countenance, the ideas become confused, there is
a disposition to yawn and a feeling of nausea. Young
children have a disposition to sleep, older ones rub their
eyes, stare wildly around and even vomit, but after a short
time they resume their accustomed employment: these symptoms
illustrate a slight concussion of the brain.</p>

<p>When the injury is more serious all the above signs become
aggravated and it may take several hours before the
normal condition is restored.</p>

<p>The proper course to pursue in all these accidents is to
lay the patient on a sofa or bed, with his head slightly elevated
in a darkened chamber free from all noise and confusion
and let him fall to sleep. In ordinary cases reaction
takes place after a quiet slumber. If however the patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
complains of pains in the head and there is irritability of
temper, the advice of a competent physician becomes necessary.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Broken bones or <i>fractures</i> are defined to be a destruction
of the continuity of one or more of the bones of the
body.</p>

<p>Fractures are divided into simple and compound; a simple
fracture is one in which the bone alone is broken, and in
which the skin or integument over the seat of the fracture
remains perfectly intact. A compound fracture is one in
which the skin and tissues over the fracture are lacerated or
wounded so that the ends of the broken bones protrude or
are exposed to view.</p>

<p>In a case of fracture, no matter of what variety, the first
object to be accomplished is to carefully remove the patient
to a place where he may be in a comfortable position. If
the fracture is in the arm or leg it should be comfortably
supported on a pillow so as to relieve the injured limb from
all strain.</p>

<p>In compound fractures, the wound should be carefully
covered with a soft clean compress which is kept thoroughly
wetted with clean cold water until the surgeon arrives.</p>

<p>Sometimes the circumstances make it necessary to remove
or transport a patient; then the injured limb must be properly
supported so that it will remain motionless on the journey.
In case the arm is fractured the above object is readily
accomplished by placing it in a sling suspended from the
neck. In the case of the lower extremities this object is
more difficult. The leg should be wrapped in cotton first,
or some other soft clean substance, after which a slat should
be placed on the outside and inside of the limb, the same
length as the limb; over and around these slats strips of
muslin or a bandage is wound so as to keep them in place.
This contrivance forms a temporary or improvised splint
until the surgeon takes charge of the case.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Wounds are defined as a recent sudden solution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
continuity in the soft parts or flesh of the body. For the
sake of convenience in description and for practical purposes,
wounds are divided into incised, lacerated, contused, punctured,
and poisoned wounds.</p>

<p>An incised wound is a clean smooth cut made by a sharp
clean-cutting instrument.</p>

<p>A lacerated wound is one in which the parts have been
torn asunder or in which the instrument was blunt or dull.</p>

<p>A contused wound is one the result of a bruise or blow
inflicted with a blunt object or by a flat surface.</p>

<p>A punctured wound is one in which the flesh is pierced
with a sharp-pointed instrument, like that made with a
stiletto or bayonet.</p>

<p>Poisoned wounds are such as have become infected any
time after the receipt of the injury, or which are the result
of a bite or sting from a reptile or insect.</p>

<p>The danger of wounds depends on their extent and
depth, and upon the locality or organ in which the wound
is situated. The external wounds, that is those which admit
of inspection, and situated on the head, trunk or extremities
are of most frequent occurrence, and the most amenable to
treatment.</p>

<p>The treatment of wounds has made wonderful progress
since the antiseptic discoveries of the eminent surgeon, Sir
Joseph Lister, and these sound principles have materially influenced
almost every department of the healing art. It was
he who first showed how dust-laden air affected injuriously
the exposed tissues of the wounds; it was he who introduced
all the precautions as to cleanliness of instruments; the disinfection
of hands; the change of clothing; and the purification
of sponges and dressings. The magnificent results of
the practice of modern surgery are not owing to the superior
skill of the surgeon of our time, but to the magnificent conception
of the idea of <i>cleanliness</i> from which has grown the
entire superstructure of antiseptic surgery, culminating in
the grand triumphs of surgical art. To the question What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
to do with recent wounds? The answer now becomes self-evident;
Keep them clean. The best dressing for any clean
wound is its own secretion carefully protected from the outside
world by a fold of clean soft cloth or absorbent cotton,
wetted with pure cold water. This is to be kept in its proper
place by means of a bandage, and when it is desirable to
remove the compress, it must first be thoroughly soaked with
water so as not to tear or irritate the wound.</p>

<p>Before Lister’s great antiseptic discovery it was the generally
accepted opinion that suppuration and pus were essential
to the healing of wounds; this was an error and the opposite
is now established to be the truth. Pus prevents or rather
delays the wounds from healing, and suppuration in wounds
is a fruitful source of blood poisoning.</p>

<p>If sand, earth, dust or dirt has gotten into or near the
wound, it must be washed off with clean, fresh water, but
never employ soiled or infected clothes for that purpose for
these may poison the wound and do a great deal of mischief.
After the wound is clean dress it in the manner described in
a preceding paragraph.</p>

<p>Poisoned wounds are chiefly punctured. The danger of
these wounds lies in the possibility that the poison is absorbed
by the lymphatics and veins, and conveyed to the heart,
whence the entire blood becomes infected. To prevent this
a ligature should be tied above the wound, by means of a
strip of muslin or preferably an elastic suspender, so as to
check the free return of the blood by the veins and lymphatics.
After which the poison should be sucked from the
wound, or the wound should be cauterized, with carbolic or nitric
acid by means of a sharp-pointed stick dipped into the acid
and then applied to the wound, or <i>fired</i> with a red-hot iron,
crochet or knitting needle. The poison of snakes and tarantulas
is neutralized with an alkali; the most efficient seems
to be spirits of ammonia, but a strong solution of washing
or even baking soda should be substituted when ammonia is
not at hand. I would puncture and enlarge the wound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
the sting with the point of a sharp knife or scissors, so that
the alkali can come into immediate contact with the injected
venom; the patient must be given frequent drinks of whisky,
brandy or strong wine until a physician arrives to supervise
further treatment.</p>

<p>Wounds inflicted by poisonous insects like the bumblebee,
honeybee, wasp, hornet, yellow jacket and mosquitoes
produce wounds which are instantly followed by a sharp,
pungent, itching pain, and in a few moments after by a pale,
circumscribed, inflammatory swelling. Some persons have
a peculiarity in their constitution that the poison of an insect
gives rise to exceedingly alarming symptoms, such as
palpitation, nausea, dizziness, dimness of sight and an indescribable
sense of suffocation. The sting is sometimes left
in the skin; for this the wound should be carefully examined,
and when present drawn out. The most prompt and useful
application is water of ammonia, or strong salt water, or
strong soapsuds. Turpentine is also a valuable application.
If the insect has lodged in the throat, large quantities of
warm salt water and mustard must be immediately administered
until the patient has vomited freely, and if there is
a sense of suffocation leeches and afterwards hot poultices
should be applied to the neck. If the system has become
poisoned, and some of the distressing symptoms that were
above enumerated are present, the internal use of whisky
or brandy is called for.</p>

<p>Hemorrhage is common to all wounds, and the loss of
the blood depends upon the size and nature of the vessel
that is injured.</p>

<p>The bleeding that takes place in ordinary superficial
wounds oozes from minute vessels, the capillaries, and slight
pressure temporarily applied controls it. When an artery
is wounded, the blood flows in intermittent jets, or in a running
pulsating stream from the vessel. The venous blood
is dark red and flows in a continuous stream and not under
the same pressure as that coming from the arteries, hence it
is much easier controlled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>The clotted blood with which a wound may be filled, is
nature’s means of arresting the hemorrhage, and it must
never be disturbed or washed off, lest this open the blood
vessels again and thereby renew the bleeding.</p>

<p>The arrest of hemorrhage is accomplished by the application
of cold or ice water, by hot water and by pressure
upon the arteries. Persons fainting from the loss of blood
should always be laid with their heads lower than the body;
cold water should be dashed into their faces so as to restore
them to consciousness. Moderate hemorrhage from the
smallest vessels and from the veins generally ceases from
slight pressure over the wounds or by drawing or pressing
the edges of the wounds together. In a very short time the
blood coagulates and forms a temporary plug until the vessels
themselves become permanently sealed by a similar
process. The pressure must often be continued for a considerable
time until the object has been attained. A folded
clean cloth or compress is laid over the wound which is the
source of the hemorrhage, and this is retained by means of a
properly adjusted bandage. If notwithstanding the pressure
exerted by the bandage or with the hands, the scarlet blood
saturates the cloth and continues to flow, it indicates that a
very large vessel is wounded, and thus life may be seriously
threatened and in proportion to the magnitude of the
wounded vessel, a surgeon should now be summoned to
make a further investigation. Hemorrhage from varicose
veins of the legs may be checked by a compress fastened
over the site of the wound by a bandage, but every constriction
around the waist or above the knee by a garter must be
loosened. If the patient’s life is threatened from the bleeding,
the limb must be elevated, and the pressure of the compress
increased, or the pressure should be exerted on the
trunk of the bleeding artery above the wound or injury.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Burns and scalds are the most commonly fatal injuries
which occur in modern life. The extended use of steam
machinery, the universal employment of coal oil, the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
use of the phosphorus and sulphur matches, and the flowing
manner of woman’s dress has materially increased the
liability of this accident. Of all accidents, burns involve
the victim in the most agonizing pain and protracted suffering.
Burns are liable to serious complications; the obstinacy
to the healing of vast ulcerated surfaces, or the lifelong
mutilation to which they condemn the unhappy patient, the
rapid draft they make on the patient’s strength, and the
danger of abscess and ulceration of internal vital organs
which eventually destroy life.</p>

<p>These injuries have been classified into three divisions:
First degree, superficial skin irritation. Second degree,
cutaneous inflammation. Third degree, devitalization of
the skin or deeper parts, or carbonization of a member,
or the entire body. The first degree is only a superficial
redness, fading without any definite edge into the
natural skin. This may be produced by the sudden and
momentary application of flame over a larger portion of the
body, from an explosion of gas. The local injury is not
dangerous, and the epidermis remains to protect the surface
of the true skin until a new layer is produced, as the injured
one peels off. This hardly calls for any other treatment but
one or several applications of sweet oil. In the second
degree, the local injury has penetrated a little deeper, and
the sudden congestion of blood to the surface, raises the
epidermis from the cutis in blisters filled with the serum of
its vessels. Here there is a more serious condition, and
indeed dangerous in proportion to the extent of surface that
has become involved. Skirts draped largely with lace, and
those made of cheese cloth, swiss, and other gauzy material
are of a very inflammable nature, and when once ignited
blaze into a flame that is almost sure to consume the material
before it can be extinguished, so that it has been deemed
advisable on the German stage, to first saturate these materials
in a solution of sulphate of ammonia to make them
non-inflammable; this does not interfere with ironing, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
with the texture or color of the fabric. Another source of
scalds and burns is the wash boiler or tub on the floor, with
hot or boiling water in it, so that little children stumble or
reach into it. Vessels filled with hot water or other fluids
standing on tables or on stoves within reach of little children,
who innocently pull the vessel down, pouring its scalding
contents over them, is another cause of numerous accidents.</p>

<p>The best course to pursue when skirts or clothing are on
fire is to roll the victim, so as to smother the flames; but the
patient herself has rarely enough presence of mind to do this.
She will run for help, thus fanning the flames, the very worst
thing she can do. Take the nearest blanket or quilt, or if
that is not at hand, take an overcoat or wrap; wrap this
around the burning person and throw her to the floor and
roll her until the flames are smothered. Then get some
cold water and pour it on the smoldering clothes until they
are thoroughly saturated, for the hot charred clothing burns
into the flesh. In scalding from hot water or steam the clothing
should be cooled off in the same manner. Cold water
must be poured over the hot and steaming clothes from head
to foot, and thus the further action of the heat is suddenly
checked. The patient should now be carefully removed to
a warm room and laid in a blanket, on the table or floor. If
he complains of thirst give a cupful of warm tea or a warm
whisky toddy.</p>

<p>Visitors and strangers should now be requested to leave
the room and the clothing should be removed from the body
with the greatest care. The scissors or a sharp knife should
be used to cut away the garments, so as to avoid all possible
straining and dragging on the patient. The blisters must
not be torn, and where they are very tense they can be
pricked with a sharp needle, so as to allow the escape of the
serum. The epidermis forms the best protection for the
cutis, and where the skin is stuck to the linen do not tear
this off, but allow it to remain and cut with a sharp scissors
around it. The application of cold water generally increases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the suffering, but sweet oil, lard oil, vaseline, castor and
china nut oil will answer for the emergency or until a more
suitable dressing can be obtained, after which the surface
should be covered with cotton batting to exclude the air.
A very useful application is a mixture of equal parts of lime
water and sweet oil or linseed oil. Carbolized sweet oil is
another useful dressing and superior to lime water liniment;
it is made in proportion of half an ounce of carbolic acid to
one pint of sweet oil; either of the above preparations can be
poured over the burned surface and then it should be covered
with cotton batting, or small pieces of soft linen cloth
can be dipped and saturated in the oil and then applied
over the burns. The advice of a physician should be sought
in view of the dangerous complications that may occur from
extensive burns.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Frostbite is the result of exposure to cold, and in certain
regions during the winter months a considerable number
are liable to this accident. But extreme cold weather is
not alone responsible for frostbite; very often this accident
occurs in moderately cold weather, for instance, if persons
exhausted from hunger or fatigued from long travels or
stupefied by alcoholic drink lay themselves down and fall
asleep, and a cold wind blows over them which withdraws the
bodily heat, the same effects are accomplished on the system.</p>

<p>The first effect of dry, cold air is a sense of numbness
and weight, with a peculiar prickling or tingling, and a rush
of blood to the surface, giving the skin a lively reddish appearance.
If the cold is maintained for any length of time
the blood leaves the surface, which becomes now of a pale
and whitish aspect, forming a striking contrast to the
previous redness. When the cold is suddenly applied and
very intense, the skin exhibits a mottled appearance, which
is due to the presence of congealed blood in the subcutaneous
veins.</p>

<p>Moist cold has a similar effect on the living tissues to
dry cold. If the hand is immersed in iced water the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
rushes immediately to the surface, so that the color of the
skin increases, which is followed by a marked degree of
numbness, and an unpleasant burning and tingling sensation.
A reaction comes on in a short time, the blood quits
the surface, and the skin becomes bleached and contracts,
the tissues underneath also shrink and become painful.
There is no difference in the effect of either moist or dry cold,
only that the former is more penetrating and its effects are
sooner apparent. Those parts of the body that are more directly
exposed and in which the circulation is not much protected
by fatty tissue, suffer the most from the effects of cold;
after exposure for an unusual length of time the toes, feet,
heels, fingers, hands, nose, and ears, together with the lips
and cheeks are for this reason oftener affected than other
parts of the body. Persons whose constitutions are broken
down by intemperance, starvation and other privations
which lower the power of resistance are more susceptible to
this accident.</p>

<p>The first effect of cold in the general system is bracing
and stimulating; an agreeable glow is felt over the surface
of the body and one feels strengthened and exhilarated.
But if the cold temperature is unusually prolonged this
agreeable sensation is changed into one of pain and drowsiness;
the brain becomes inactive as if under the influence of
a powerful opiate or narcotic, and the desire to go to sleep is
so strong that it requires the greatest effort to keep awake.
To yield to this inclination to sleep would result in slumber
that knows no waking, for the blood would now rapidly accumulate
in the internal organs, the breathing would become
irregular and spasmodic, the nervous functions would soon
be suspended and death would ensue from general paralysis.
An individual thus exposed, so as to have become drowsy or
unconscious and then suddenly brought into a hot room is
likely to die from congestion of the brain and lungs, or if he
should revive for a short time, the frost-bitten parts will be
stricken with mortification. Professor Samuel D. Gross says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
“The treatment of frostbite requires no little judgment and
adroitness to conduct it to a successful issue. The great indication
is to recall the affected parts gradually to their natural
condition by restoring circulation and sensibility, in
the most gentle and cautious manner, not suddenly, or by
severe measures. The first thing to be done is to immerse
them in iced water, or rub them with snow, the friction being
made as carefully and lightly as possible, lest overaction
be produced, as they are necessarily greatly weakened. If
no ice or snow is at hand, the coldest well water that can be
procured must be used; and if immersion is inconvenient,
wet cloths are applied, with the precaution of maintaining
the supply of cold and moisture by constant irrigation.
Moderate reaction is aimed at and fostered. All warm applications,
whether dry or moist, are scrupulously refrained
from; the patient must not approach the fire, nor immerse
his limbs in hot water, or even be in a warm room. Attention
to these precepts must on no account be disregarded,
as its neglect would be almost certainly followed by mortification
or other disastrous consequences.”</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Drowning or the submersion of an individual until
life is destroyed by suffocation is not an uncommon accident.
“The immediate cause of death in drowning,” says Dr. Gross,
“is suffocation or insufficiency of air. Respiration being thus
arrested, the blood is unaerated and consequently unfitted
for life, although the circulation may go on for a short time
after breathing has completely ceased.”</p>

<p>The Navarino sponge divers whose occupation has accustomed
them to live under water the extreme limit, average
only seventy-six seconds, while the Ceylon pearl divers
seldom remain under water with impunity more than two-thirds
of that time.</p>

<p>Dr. Gross says: “The period at which a person after submersion
may be resuscitated varies very much in different
cases and under different circumstances. In some cases, for
reasons not always explicable, recovery is found to be impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
at the end of one minute. The chances are never
good after submersion of twice this length of time, especially
when the water and the air are both uncommonly cold.</p>

<p>“The treatment of apnœa from drowning must be prompt
and decided. Every moment of time is most precious. The
body being removed from the water to a dry place, is immediately
stripped, wiped, and covered with a blanket, especially
in cold weather. The mouth, nostrils and throat are cleared
of mucus, froth, and any other substances likely to interfere
with the admission of air to the lungs; the tongue is to be
pulled out at the corner of the mouth, and prevented from
falling back upon the glottis; ammonia is rapidly passed to
and fro under the nose; and the body is stretched out at
full length with the face downwards, the forehead resting
upon one arm, for the purpose of allowing any water that
may be in the stomach and air passages to escape by the
mouth and nose. If these means do not speedily revive the
patient, artificial respiration is instituted. For this purpose,
the body being placed upon its back, with the head slightly
elevated, the arms, grasped just above the elbows, are carried
outwards and upwards from the chest almost perpendicularly,
and retained in this position for about two seconds,
the object of the procedure being designed to promote the
introduction of air into the lungs as in natural breathing.
They are then lowered and brought closely to the sides of
the chest, where they are held for the same length of time,
to expel the air, the effect being aided by pressure applied
to the inferior and lateral portions of the chest. These alternate
movements of elevation and depression from twelve to
fourteen times a minute, and are performed with all possible
gentleness. As soon as signs of life are observed, dry warmth
should be applied to the extremities, the region of the heart,
loins, and abdomen, a little brandy and water being administered,
or if deglutition be impracticable, thrown into the
rectum.”</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Poisons and their antidotes form an important subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
for our consideration, because many of the poisons are
among the most useful remedies. The daily accounts in
the public press of serious and fatal mistakes in the administration
of medicines, are always due to carelessness and very
often to criminal negligence.</p>

<p>No package or bottle should be kept about the house
without its proper label.</p>

<p>Those that contain poisonous drugs or chemical preparations
should be plainly marked <span class="smcap">Poison</span>, besides the name of
their contents.</p>

<p>Vials or packages containing poisonous drugs or chemicals
must not be kept on the same shelf and near those
medicines that are comparatively harmless.</p>

<p>Always look at the label twice; once before the contents
are poured out, and a second time, before the dose is swallowed.
Never take medicine in the dark, in the belief that
you are certain of the right vial and locality; many a sad
accident has occurred from this venture.</p>

<p>Sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acid cause great heat and
a sensation of burning pain from the mouth down to the
stomach. Acids are neutralized by alkalies, hence one teaspoonful
of washing soda or two teaspoonfuls of bicarbonate
of soda dissolved in a pint of water should be drunk as soon
as possible: chalk or powdered magnesia mixed with water
will also answer the purpose.</p>

<p>Oxalic acid is frequently mistaken for Epsom salts; lime
water, chalk or magnesia mixed with water and taken in
large quantities are antidotes: then administer emetics, which
act more quickly if the stomach is filled with fluids; sometimes
the finger run down the throat will excite quick and
sufficient vomiting.</p>

<p>Creosote and carbolic acid benumb the stomach so that
emetics usually will not act, and large quantities of sweet oil
or castor oil should be first drunk; I prefer the former because
from one to two pints of it can be taken; after which
lime water or a solution of Glauber salt (sulphate of sodium)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
should be taken; the latter is especially recommended as
neutralizing carbolic acid. When circumstances make it
possible the stomach pump or india rubber siphon tube
should be at once employed.</p>

<p>Alkalies, for example, caustic potassa, soda, lye, strong solution
of ammonia, earths and lime are neutralized by drinking
vinegar or lemon or lime juice; afterwards milk in water
and flaxseed tea.</p>

<p>Arsenic: Give the white of eggs, lime water or chalk and
water; tablespoonful doses of carbonate of iron, mixed with
water, or calcined magnesia in the same manner, then evacuate
the stomach with an ipecac emetic.</p>

<p>Corrosive sublimate: Give white of eggs, or wheat flour
mixed with water; afterwards give an emetic.</p>

<p>Alcohol: First cleanse out the stomach with an emetic,
then dash cold water on the head and give frequent doses of
aromatic spirits of ammonia in water.</p>

<p>Charcoal or coal gas poisoning: Remove the patient into
the open air, dash cold water on the head and body and
stimulate by passing ammonia to and fro under the nostrils,
at the same time rubbing the chest briskly.</p>

<p>Lead: White lead and sugar of lead should first be treated
with alum emetic, afterwards a cathartic of castor oil or
Epsom salt.</p>

<p>Nitrate of silver (lunar caustic): Give a strong solution
of common salt, and then emetics.</p>

<p>Prussic acid or cyanide of potassium. For this no certain
antidote exists, and it destroys life so suddenly as scarcely
to allow of use if we had one. When there is time chlorine
in solution has been recommended, also water of ammonia
and cold affusions.</p>

<p>Opium, laudanum and morphine require the same antidote.
If the patient can swallow an emetic should be given;
twenty grains of sulphate of zinc and a teaspoonful of powdered
ipecac mixed in a draught of water should be given
every twenty or thirty minutes until vomiting is insured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
A mixture of half teaspoonful of mustard and a tablespoonful
of salt dissolved in a pint or quart of warm water is
another efficient emetic in these cases. If swallowing is
impossible the stomach pump must be used. When the
stomach is cleansed out give strong coffee and acid drinks,
dash cold water on the head and keep the patient walking.</p>

<p>Belladonna and black henbane: Give emetics, and afterwards
a dose of paregoric, and a hot whisky toddy, or a
cupful of strong tea.</p>

<p>Nux Vomica and strychnine have no reliable chemical
antidote; emetics should first be given, or the stomach washed
out with a siphon tube or stomach pump. Chloroform must
be employed to control the spasms, then alcoholic stimulants
should be freely administered.</p>

<p>Aconite, digitalis, hemlock, lobelia, cantharides, poisonous
mushrooms or toadstools, etc., have no certain antidotes.
Emetics should be immediately given when any of them
are known to have been taken. Animal charcoal is recommended
to absorb and render harmless organic poisons in
the stomach; teaspoonful doses mixed with water should be
given repeatedly, and for those drugs least depressing in
their action castor oil is also recommended.</p>

<p>When a prompt emetic is urgently demanded and no
drugs of any kind are at hand, large quantities of tepid water
should be drunk, say half gallon to a gallon; this distends
the stomach mechanically, and by titillating the throat
prompt and effective vomiting may be excited; this may
be repeated as often as necessary and the stomach thoroughly
washed out.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<p class="pch">SOMETHING ABOUT DIET.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been truthfully said that “many persons dig their
graves with their teeth,” but, that improper feeding causes
many a grave to be dug is also true.</p>

<p>So never feel sorry or disappointed when the family
physician makes a professional visit, and fails to write a
prescription, but instead, gives you instruction in the art of
feeding and nursing the patient.</p>

<p>Food and stimulants support the strength of the system
until the struggle between health and disease or between
life and death is overcome, and thus cure the patient by
not allowing him to starve. There is a large group of diseases
for which there are no acknowledged remedies, and
in which a properly selected and regulated diet forms the
mainstay of successful treatment. This should be combined
with healthy, clean rooms, proper ventilation, and other hygienic
means which may suggest themselves to the intelligent
practitioner.</p>

<p>The patient’s fancy for this or that article of diet is no
index, as a rule, of what is best suited for him; invalid appetites
and cravings are abnormal; they are like that of the
chlorotic girl who eats chalk and slate pencils, instead of
wholesome food and some preparation of iron.</p>

<p>An aversion to food is also no criterion of the patient’s
need for nourishment, for the sense of taste is generally
blunted or perverted. The desire for food is lost in all diseases
of a catarrhal nature of the mouth or stomach, and
in those that are characterized by high temperature. In
typhoid fever and diseases of a typhoid nature this is always
the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>With children this aversion to food is greater and more
general than with adults; and it must be made a rule that
their refusal to take nourishment must not be extended
beyond several days, otherwise they fail so rapidly in conjunction
with the disease as to perish from exhaustion.</p>

<p>The repugnance to food arises from abnormal conditions
that are generally localized in the mouth and especially in
the parts of the tongue which are supplied by the nerves of
taste; these nerves are the lingual branch of the trifacial and
the glasso-pharyngeal. But notwithstanding that the food
is almost tasteless, when it gets into the stomach it is
retained and properly digested and the patient feels better
for having taken it. An appetite can be thus cultivated,
and after a few days of coaxing or perhaps of forcible feeding,
which in children who are failing rapidly becomes
necessary in order to save them, the taste and desire for nourishment
become natural or restored. Quite often patients
beg and plead not to be given food; but in wasting diseases
it should be insisted that some at least should be taken (always
liquid of course), and when they are sufficiently rational
they will always afterward admit that the nourishment
did them good.</p>

<p>Liquid food or nourishment and no other is suitable for
a sick person; an invalid can drink food when it would be
impossible for him to swallow solid material. I have often
seen the whim of patients who craved meat indulged; they
got a juicy porterhouse steak with the understanding that
it was to be thoroughly masticated before swallowing.
As a rule, the patient is disappointed with his own bill
of fare, and after trying one or two mouthfuls orders
the meat taken away with the remark that it is as dry
as a chip. But this same person will drink a milk punch,
a thin gruel with the yellow or all of an egg beaten into it,
with some degree of relish; salt should always be added and
indeed, as much as the taste will permit, but sugar should
be used as sparingly as possible. Salt is what is needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
above all other seasoning; the system requires the chlorides
for they are wasted in fevers, but even in health, the chlorides
are very essential and salt is the best one we have; salt is
the source of the hydrochloric acid in the stomach and one
of the most important factors in albuminous digestion.</p>

<p>The saliva is not secreted in sufficient quantity in fever
to allow insalivation of food, or to moisten the solid morsel
sufficiently to permit its being swallowed without a choking
sensation as it glides into the stomach. A person prostrated
by disease has not the strength to masticate solid food and
that is another reason why liquid food is to be given.</p>

<p>The famous physiologist, Dr. E. Brown-Séquard, is the
author of a method for feeding the sick peculiarly his own,
namely, that of administering small quantities of food at short
intervals. He would give a glassful of milk punch in tablespoonful
doses, repeating every ten or fifteen minutes; this
method is advised for the treatment and cure of dyspepsia,
anæmia, chlorosis, nervous diseases and even organic diseases
of the stomach. No particular kind of food was selected for
this treatment; butter, milk, cheese, and meats, bread and
potatoes were alike to be given in small quantities and at
short intervals. One or two mouthfuls even to be eaten at
a time, and then repeated in ten or fifteen minutes, until
thirty to forty ounces are consumed daily. This system
never became a recognized expedient, it is wrong in theory,
and certainly in practice; while it may be applicable in
isolated cases, they would be so very few that this method
of feeding forms the exception and not the rule.</p>

<p>Cases are frequently met with, especially in infants and
older children whose digestion has been completely ruined by
being fed too often. These cases are not really overfed, because
the entire amount in the twenty-four hours, does not
exceed the requisite quantity; but giving the food in driblets
and at short intervals, causes lactic fermentation, or in plain
English, the food sours on the stomach and does not digest,
as it would do if a proper time were interposed between each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
feeding. As soon as the patients are fed at regular and longer
intervals, say, from two to four hours, the indigestion corrects
itself. During the interval, between the time set for feeding,
the children will naturally cry; this is interpreted by the
mother or nurse as a sign of hunger, but nothing is oftener
further from the truth. The child cries generally for one of
three reasons: one of these may be that it wants to be taken
up, and dandled or rocked, to which previous indulgences
have accustomed it; or it may have pain in the stomach and
bowels as a natural result of indigestion or flatulence; or the
child may cry from thirst or a sensation of dryness in the
mouth and throat; in any event, additional food would only
prove injurious. There is no objection against giving nurslings
cold water between their meals when they are thirsty
or feverish, but warm aromatic tea is so very much superior
that I consider it one of the essentials of the nursery. I mean
fennel seed tea, of which a sufficient quantity should be prepared
every morning to last twenty-four hours; this should
be strained and sweetened, then set aside for further use.
When the child is restless, between meals, some of the tea
should be warmed, and given from the nursing bottle until
it is satisfied, for the tea soothes the pain, quenches the thirst
and dispels the flatus.</p>

<p>There are also physiological reasons for these longer intervals
between nursing; they allow the stomach sufficient
time to dispose of its contents before another mess is given
to disturb the digestion of former food, which is as yet incomplete.
There is another immense advantage in having the
length of time between two meals from two to four hours;
it allows time for medication and other necessary management
of the sick, for sponging off with cold water in fevers,
and many other things which are necessary for the patient’s
comfort and convalescence, and which can only be carried
out between the times the nourishment is given. A memorandum
should be kept in the sick room and the time and
hour noted when everything becomes due in proper order;
this avoids confusion and lessens labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>Digestion is the solution of the food in the stomach for
purposes of nutrition. Nitrogenous materials, egg, meat,
muscle are digested principally in the stomach, but not entirely
so, because the particles of albuminous food which
pass from the stomach into the upper portion of the small
intestine come into contact with the pancreatic fluid, which
is the digestive agent for fats and starches, but which possesses
also powerful digestive properties for nitrogenous or
albuminous substances and even in a greater degree than
the gastric juice of the stomach, which has a strong acid reaction,
while the pancreatic juice has an alkali reaction;
here is a very interesting illustration how similar digestive
processes are accomplished under opposite chemical conditions.
The intelligent reader must not fail to observe, from
what has been said, that there are two distinctly different digestive
processes, namely one going on in the stomach and
another equally as important taking place in the small intestines.</p>

<p>Pepsin is the active principle of the gastric juice, held
in solution in a clear colorless liquid, principally water; it
has a sour taste and a peculiar characteristic sour smell.
The length of time required by the gastric fluid to dissolve
the food depends greatly upon the minuteness of the division
of the solid substances to be acted upon, as well as upon
the quantity and quality of the peptic fluid.</p>

<p>The pepsin changes the physical properties of nitrogenous
substances so as to make them soluble in water in
any proportion and when the albuminoids have acquired
this property they are termed peptones; peptones are simply
nitrogenous food which has been modified to fit it for absorption
and nutrition of the body.</p>

<p>In the tissues of the body there are continual changes
going on, termed in technical language tissue metamorphosis;
the waste products that are thus formed constitute a
group of highly nitrogenized substances, which in a healthy
condition of the system are eliminated by the kidneys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
These nitrogenized products are urea, urate of soda and uric
acid; the accumulation of any of these substances in the
blood gives rise to disease; the former is the cause of uræmia
and uræmic convulsions, and the latter have been detected
in the blood and exudations in cases of gouty and rheumatic
disease. The characteristic gouty deposit is urate of soda,
due to an excess of nitrogenous elements of the blood. An
excess of uric acid constitutes a disease which is first recognized
by a reddish crystalline sediment in the urine; the
term <i>lithiasis</i> has been employed to denote this peculiarity.
These lithates are always to be found in the urine of high livers
and are due to an excessive consumption of nitrogenous
food. The great English authority, Dr. Murchison, looks
upon the excessive production of uric acid, or lithic acid, as
it is sometimes called, as due to one of two causes and sometimes
to both, namely to the excessive consumption of nitrogenous
food, or to an inability of the liver to perform its duty,
which among other things is to dispose of the nitrogenous
waste products. From this point of view lithates or brick
dust deposits in the urine are no sign that the kidneys are
deranged, but quite the reverse may be true when the kidneys
are overburdened in eliminating this excessive waste, for they
are performing extra duty, which excess in living or a sluggish
liver imposes upon them, and this may excite inflammation
in the tissues of the kidneys and develop into what
is known as Bright’s disease.</p>

<p>This very interesting exposition of the deposit of lithates
or gravel in the urine will naturally suggest that when the
urine is overloaded with these nitrogenous products nitrogenous
food like eggs, cheese, beef, etc., should not be eaten
for awhile, and that a vegetable diet should be principally
relied upon, thus giving the liver a vacation; the diet
should be supplemented with plenty of clean fresh water,
and no liquors of any sort should be taken by those whose
liver is affected.</p>

<p>Starch, sugar and fat are composed of carbon, hydrogen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
and oxygen; starches and sugars are termed carbo-hydrates;
because the hydrogen and oxygen is always present in them
in equal atomic weights so as to represent water; while in
the fats the oxygen is considerably less. This is exemplified
by comparing the chemical equivalents of starch and
cane sugar with those of fats:</p>

</table>

<p>When starch is boiled with diluted nitric, sulphuric or
muriatic acid for thirty-six to forty hours, it becomes colorless
and thin like water, and is converted into a species of
sugar. A similar process takes place when starch is taken
as food, the diastase of the saliva, and the pancreatic and intestinal
juices change starch into <i>glucose</i>, in which form it
is ready for nutrition.</p>

<p>Cane and other sugars introduced into the system as ingredients
of fruits and vegetables are not absorbed as such,
but undergo a process of digestion which converts them into
grape sugar or glucose; after that they are suitable for nutrition
and absorption into the blood, but not before.</p>

<p>The digestion of starches and sugars has been incidentally
referred to as not taking place in the stomach but in the
upper portion of the small intestine, through the agency of
the pancreatic juice which has the peculiar property of converting
farinaceous and saccharine matters into grape sugar.
But this transformation into grape sugar is not the final
product of digestion. In the normal process of intestinal absorption
the grape sugar is taken up by the portal capillary
vessels and carried to the liver, where under the influence of
this organ it is changed into liver sugar or glycogen, and it is
as glycogen that it again enters the circulation, to disappear
in the lungs. But if the liver from disease or other causes
fails to perform this task, the glucose passes through the organ
unaltered, and as such again enters the circulation where it
acts as an irritant and finally is eliminated by the kidneys
in the urine giving rise to the affection known as diabetes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>We have learned that there is a stomachic digestion and
an intestinal digestion, the former principally for meats, or
that class which are now called nitrogenous foods, while the
latter is confined generally to starches and fats. This physiological
fact suggested the idea of feeding dyspeptics only
on such food as is not acted upon in the stomach, but
passes beyond that cavity to become digested in the small
intestines, giving the stomach a rest as it were so that it
may recuperate and gain strength while the system is being
fed by farinaceous aliments. While a superficial glance
justified such a procedure, a moment’s reflection proves it to
be a delusion, and for this reason, that there will be an unavoidable
irritation of the stomach which the journey of the
farinaceous material occasions in its passage through the
stomach, and the insufficient nutritive value of a simple non-nitrogenous
diet causes a rapid loss of tissue and bodily
strength; hence this course proved itself impracticable and
was abandoned. Then again the experiment was tried of
putting a certain class of dyspeptics on a purely meat diet; this
had one fault common with the former plan; it was also too
one-sided, and the system suffered for want of fat and starch,
and secondly peptones were not always formed in the stomach
from a deficiency of the gastric juice or an impairment of its
quality, so that this method was also abandoned.</p>

<p>Fats belong to the starches and sugars as heat producers;
they are insoluble in water, and by boiling them in caustic
alkali they are decomposed into soap and glycerine. In the
cavity of the stomach fats remain unaltered; the heat of the
stomach may melt or liquefy them, but in no other way are
they changed. They are also digested, like the starches, in
the small intestine by the action of the pancreatic juice
which possesses the remarkable property when brought in contact
with fatty or oily matter at the temperature of the body
of emulsifying it, and of converting the fats into a milky,
white, opaque looking fluid, by a minute subdivision of the
oily particles. This emulsion of the fatty and other substances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
of the food is termed chyle, and as such, the fatty substances
are ready for absorption by the absorbents of the intestinal
tract. Experience teaches that a deficiency of fat
causes scrofulous diseases, and this class of patients have generally
a repugnance for fat; this is another illustration of the
unreliability of patients to choose their own food. Professor
John H. Bennet first pointed out the usefulness of cod liver
oil in consumption and other scrofulous diseases, and directed
attention to the value of fat in the nutrition of the body.</p>

<p>Dr. Ferguson made extensive observations on the little
children of the factory operatives of Lancashire, Eng. The
children were principally fed on tea or water and bread,
little or no fat, bacon, butter or cream, and they grew up
into puny and stunted men and women, while those who
had a bread and milk diet grew into hardier and finer human
specimens.</p>

<p>Fat is also an essential food for the brain and general
nervous system; the lean are the nervous patients and not
the fat and sleek, hence fatty food is considered an important
diet for this class of diseases. The brain and nerve fat
is called “lecithin” and a little phosphorus enters into its
composition. Chronic obstinate neuralgia has often been
cured by the administration of cod liver oil.</p>

<p>Milk is the only single article of diet which possesses in
itself all the properties to supply the wants of the system,
and it may be profitable to give this subject more than passing
notice. It is the natural and most wholesome food for
the infant when it can suck it from its mother’s breast; instinctively
the newborn rolls its little head hither and thither
in search for this fountain of infantile life and however great
the skill of the chemist in approaching the composition of
mother’s milk, he can never produce an equally good substitute.
Milk contains all the principles which are necessary for
human food, the nitrogenous, the oleaginous and the saccharine,
and these are blended in such proportion that milk
is adapted for the complete nourishment of the young and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
old. In no other single substance supplied by nature
does a similar combination exist; it contains the material
for the consolidation of bone and for the formation of the red
blood corpuscles, by carrying in solution the phosphates of
lime, magnesia and iron; in this respect an analysis of milk
shows a remarkable similarity to blood. The proportions of
the different constituents of milk are liable to great variations
and are greatly influenced by the nature of the food.</p>

<p>Dr. Playfair of London, who has made some interesting
researches regarding the milk of the cow, has demonstrated
that the amount of butter depends in part upon the quantity
of oily matter in the food and in part on the amount of exercise
which the animal takes; and upon the warmth of the
atmosphere in which it is kept. Exercise and cold weather
eliminate the oily matter or butter, in the form of carbonic
acid and water, while rest and warmth diminish this drain
by favoring its passage into milk. On the other hand, the
proportion of the cheesy matter is increased by exercise.</p>

<p>In Switzerland, where the cattle pasture in very exposed
situations and where, from the rolling of the country, they
are obliged to use a great deal of muscular exertion the
quantity of butter yielded by the cows is very small, while
the cheese is in unusually large proportions; but the same
cattle when stall fed give a large quantity of butter and
very little cheese.</p>

<p>The character of the food will decide the nature and
healthfulness of the milk. The best food for milch cows is
bran or middlings mixed with well-seasoned and sweet-cut
hay, and this mixture thoroughly scalded and saturated
with boiling water; a little flaxseed oil cake, should be
added occasionally, for it enriches the milk and keeps the
cattle in good condition; during the day the cows should be
in the open air; they should not be irritated by dogs, or
made to run or trot; these things will affect the milk injuriously.
To feed cows on kitchen garbage or swill of any
sort will taint the milk so that the offensive odors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
swill can be readily detected, especially after the milk has
stood awhile; such milk is particularly dangerous to infants
and should at once be discontinued. Distillery slops are
often fed to cattle in large cities; these are not only productive
of poisonous milk but also injure the cattle so that they become
salivated and lose their teeth after a few years of this diet.
Brewers’ grains are not open to the same objection as whisky
slops; a certain proportion of brewers’ grains added to the
cut food increases the flow of milk. In all large towns there
are families who keep one or two cows and who sell the milk
as a means of making a livelihood: as a rule these cattle are
fed on swill, and not upon the best quality of food, and although
this milk is recommended as being pure and one
cow’s milk, it is as a rule not good, for the stalls and the food
do not come up to the requirements for wholesome milk.</p>

<p>I have always found a healthier and purer milk from the
dairies run on a large scale, and outside of the centers of
population. The cattle look healthier, have better food,
good pasturage and pure country air, and if the milk is
properly chilled or cooled off before it is poured into the
wagon cans, country dairy milk is to be greatly preferred over
city milk. The animal heat should have left the milk
before it is put into cans for transportation, for it is the animal
heat in tightly closed vessels which causes the chemical
changes that encourage the development of organic milk
poisons or so-called <i>ptomaines</i>.</p>

<p>Milk promiscuously mixed from a group of apparently
healthy cows is preferable to that of one cow, and for several
reasons; the honesty of dairymen is doubtful, for they will
not take the extra trouble to keep the milk of one cow apart
when the cows are being milked; again tuberculosis or consumption
in all its stages is a common disease among cattle,
and quite often a milch cow has tuberculosis when she seems
healthy. If a child should subsist on the milk from a
tuberculous cow, serious consequences would undoubtedly
ensue, but if this milk had been mixed with that of thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
or forty healthy cows, the danger of infection would be correspondingly
lessened.</p>

<p>Cow’s milk should average 12 per cent. of cream; if it
contain less than 8 per cent., it is probable that the milk is
watered or that it was skimmed. A cream gauge is a cylindrical
glass vessel about one and a half inches in diameter
and eight inches high, with a capacity of 12 fluid ounces.
This tubular measure is graduated so as to make it possible
to read off from the top downwards 1, 2, 3, etc., parts or
drams of cream which gradually rises to the surface. This
glass is filled with the suspected specimen of milk up to the
highest mark and set aside for 24 hours, at an ordinary temperature;
at the expiration of that time the quantity of
cream which rose to the surface of the milk is read off, and in
this manner it is easy to see the proportion of cream to the entire
bulk of milk tested. Above it was stated that 12 per cent.
is an average for good milk, and 14 per cent. is extra good,
while 8 per cent. is the lowest that is permissible. If the percentage
falls below 8 per cent. it is a sign that the milk has
been skimmed, and if the density or specific gravity is below
27 degrees, then it is to be presumed that the milk has also
been watered, for sometimes the milk is both skimmed and
watered.</p>

<p>The density or specific gravity of milk gives an approximate
idea of the quantity of solid matter a given specimen
submitted for examination contains, as compared with pure
water. The lactometer or galactometer is a kind of hydrometer,
but specially graduated to readily read off the density
which pure milk should have. Pure milk at a temperature
of 55 to 60 degrees should have a specific gravity varying
between 27 and 33 degrees and if the sample falls below 27
degrees, it is to be presumed that water has been added.
The density of diluted milk is sometimes maintained by
boiled starch water; this can be detected by adding a few
drops of tincture of iodine, which changes the starch into a
beautiful violet blue, also giving the adulterated milk a
similar tint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>It must always be remembered that while milk presents
itself in a liquid form it becomes a semi-solid in the stomach
in the ordinary process of digestion; this change is
accomplished by the action of the gastric ferment, curdling
the milk. Milk is not a diluent for solid foods and it should
never be drank as a substitute for water when other solid
food has been eaten. The practice of eating a regular meal
of meat and vegetables and drinking milk at the same time
invariably overloads the stomach, and if it does not injure
the digestion immediately it is sure to do so in time; it also
furnishes an oversupply of nitrogenous food, developing an
excess of lithates or uric acid, and this burdens the liver and
kidneys. If a person is fond of milk it is most excellent as
a principal article of diet at a meal, and indeed nothing is
better than a bowl of well-prepared mush or a few slices of
bread with a pint of fresh milk for either breakfast or supper.</p>

<p>Boiled milk has considerable healing and binding virtues;
it may be thickened with a teaspoonful of wheat flour to the
pint, and taken quite warm; as a household remedy, it is
one of the most valuable in ordinary cases of diarrhœa, but
no other food should be taken until the cure is effected.</p>

<p>The milk cure is a well-established and recognized expedient
for the relief and cure of a certain class of patients,
and as the success of the regimen depends upon an intelligent
employment of the fluid, it becomes necessary to enter
somewhat into the detail of its administration.</p>

<p>The milk-shake, that is milk shaken in a tumbler or
beaten with an eggbeater for several minutes is frequently
borne by persons who cannot digest milk which has not been
so treated; then again, a teaspoonful of mush or gruel added
to a tumblerful of milk and thoroughly beaten, divides the
curd mechanically when it forms in the stomach, and so
makes the milk much more soluble by the gastric juice.</p>

<p>Milk should never be drank cold, but at a temperature of
about 100° F., which is about as warm as it comes from the
cow, for cold delays the curdling and hence the digestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
of the milk, and gives it time to develop acid or lactic
fermentation in the stomach, and this may cause indigestion;
a pinch of salt should be added to milk, it assists
in its digestion. There must be certain periods at which to
take milk, allowing a definite interval for the milk to digest;
taking milk in mouthfuls, for instance as a drink instead
of water is wrong, for this will ferment and occasion indigestion.
The proper length to intervene between each meal of
milk is four hours; breakfast 8 o’clock, dinner at 12 o’clock,
lunch at 4 and supper at 8 o’clock; if the patient is considerably
exhausted, the time between 8 o’clock in the evening
and the same hour in the morning may be too long, and if
the patient is awake, a meal should be given at midnight.</p>

<p>The quantity of milk which may be taken for one meal
is of great importance, for there is the same danger of taking
too much of this food as of any other. The average quantity
to begin with must not exceed half a pint, and when
the appetite is capricious one-fourth of a pint is sufficient.
It is now fully established that a grown person can be fairly
well nourished for quite a while on one quart of milk in the
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>It is also of considerable importance to the patient that
he does not gulp the milk as this would cause it to curd into
a large cohesive mass of casein, which would be slowly dissolved
or acted upon by the gastric juice, and might give
rise to distress from indigestion. If, on the other hand, the
patient sips the milk slowly, or eats it with a spoon, the
curds will be small and flaky particles which even a weak
stomach may digest. There are quite a number of persons
who like milk, yet whose stomachs do not take to it, and for
these a milk cure might be just the thing. It requires often
a great deal of ingenuity to devise a plan whereby the obstacle
may be overcome. The first step should be to shorten
the interval between each meal and lessen the quantity correspondingly;
thus to give the patient the milk every hour
would imply that he was to take only one-fourth as much at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
a time as if he took it every four hours. Perhaps the milk
would digest more easily if it were first beaten and slightly
seasoned with a pinch of salt, or if a little strained gruel
were added to mechanically divide the curd. A soda cracker,
toasted bread, or the rind of thoroughly baked wheaten bread
is an excellent substitute for dividing the cheesy substance
of the milk when it gets into the stomach. They should not
be soaked or dipped into the milk and eaten together, but
eaten dry and thoroughly masticated until the saliva has reduced
the bread to a soft pulp, after which a spoonful of milk
should be taken and the bread stuff washed down. The
saliva serves another useful purpose besides moistening the
bread as it changes the starchy substance into sugar.</p>

<p>In other cases the milk sours on the stomach, and then
some antacid or alkali, like lime water or bicarbonate of
soda should be added for several days or until the disposition
to lactic fermentation has subsided. If notwithstanding
every precaution, waterbrash, heartburn, or a heavy oppressed
pain in the stomach occurs, or if sourish, slimy
secretions are vomited, the milk cure must be abandoned
for something else.</p>

<p>Diarrhœal diseases of infants who are fed on cow’s milk
are caused, in many instances, by germs or spores that get
into the milk from lack of proper cleanliness and from the
unavoidable exposure of the fluid to the atmosphere of
stables and dairy rooms where the milk is handled before
transportation to consumers. To obviate the danger of feeding
nurslings with infected milk, and to destroy the vitality
of germs which find access to the milk, methods have been
devised for <i>sterilizing</i> the milk. This process was first proposed
in 1886 by Professor Soxhlet, and has ever since gained
favor with the profession; it consists of exposing the milk to
a temperature of live steam or boiling water for about forty-five
minutes. In New York City there are two reliable firms
which sterilize milk at the dairy in the country and ship it
to the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>In all the methods of sterilization the milk is placed in
six or eight-ounce bottles and set on a tray or shelf, which
stands above the water at the bottom of a vessel, the cover
then applied and the water made to boil forty-five minutes;
a perforated stopper is inserted into each flask, admitting of
the escape of air and gases at the beginning of the heating
process. The stopper may consist of cork with a glass tube
in the center, or cotton, or of rubber with a channel a part
of the distance on one side. If necessary the family can improvise
their own apparatus; an inverted tin pan will serve
the purpose of a tray to support the nursing bottles, and this
placed in the bottom of an ordinary tin vessel with a cover
completes the contrivance. The milk is to be prepared as it
is to be administered, that is, the proper quantity of water,
a little sugar, and the point of a penknifeful of bicarbonate
of soda added, and distributed among as many eight-ounce
flasks or nursing bottles as the child is fed during the
twenty-four hours; thus if fed every four hours the milk
should be distributed among six flasks, and if fed every
three hours, it would require eight flasks. When the milk
has been sterilized, it keeps sweet for an indefinite period
at ordinary temperature; the bottle is to be well shaken to
mix the cream before the cork is removed and the nipple
applied.</p>

<p>When an apparatus or a sufficient number of flasks cannot
be readily obtained I have the milk boiled in a fruit jar
after the manner of making beef tea, as follows: A quart
preserve jar is filled with milk, obtained not later than four
to six hours after milking, the cover is lightly put on, to
allow the escape of air and gases, and then the jar is put
into a vessel, on the bottom of which an inverted pan has
been placed so that the preserve jar does not rest on the
bottom of the vessel where the heat would crack it; the
vessel is then to be filled a third with water, and this
boiled for an hour, after which the jar is carefully closed,
as in preserving fruit, until wanted for use. The milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
should be kept in a cool and clean place, and only as much
measured out each time as is required for one mess, after
which immediately close the jar. The water that is to be
used for diluting the milk must have been thoroughly boiled;
it is always better to prepare and dilute the milk before sterilizing
it for very young infants, but when they are a year
or more old, the boiling water may be added at each meal.</p>

<p>The casein, which is the curd or coagulable part of milk,
differs greatly in its physical property in the milk of the
cow from that in human milk. Mother’s milk curds in <i>soft
flaky coagula</i> which are readily dissolved in the infant’s
stomach, while cow’s milk curds in a semi-solid conglomerate
coagulum which the cavity of the child’s stomach is
often unable to tolerate nor the gastric juice to penetrate
and dissolve. It is this heavy curd which forms the main
objectionable feature of cow’s milk as a substitute for that
of the mother. This can be greatly modified by first thoroughly
beating or churning the cow’s milk with an egg
beater, and afterwards scalding it as above described; the
milk treated in this manner curds light and flaky. But it
must not be presumed that the physical characteristic of
casein is the only peculiarity of cow’s milk in comparison
with mother’s milk, for this is not so; it also differs in quantity,
that is, mother’s milk has less of casein, a fact which
may be better understood by the following chemical analysis
of both:</p>

<p>There are some children who are unable to digest cow’s
milk in any form, either from a peculiarity of constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
or from a derangement of the digestive apparatus; the milk,
no matter how prepared, passes through them curdled, in
lumps and undigested; to continue feeding infants on milk,
notwithstanding this symptom would in all probability sacrifice
the life of the child. If curds persist in the stools
milk is to be withheld for a time, and crushed wheat, barley
gruel or other diluents should be given alone or in combination
with the thoroughly beaten white of egg. This
treatment must be continued for several days and in some
cases for several weeks.</p>

<p>Whey prepared from sweet and pure milk has often been
borne by delicate and suffering infants, when nothing else
could be retained. An examination into the chemical composition
of whey reveals astonishing nutritive virtue, which
it holds in solution; the following table shows the proportional
constituents in one hundred parts:</p>

<p>When the whey is the product of soured milk, 0.33 or more
of lactic acid is to be added to this analysis, and the same
amount deducted from the sugar of milk. Essence of pepsin
will curd lukewarm milk, not warmer than can be agreeably
borne by the mouth; a temperature higher than one hundred
and fifteen degrees Fahrenheit destroys the curdling principle
of the pepsin. The quantity of essence of pepsin to be used to
the pint of milk depends on the strength of the preparation;
usually a teaspoonful or two is added and stirred just enough
to mix; let it stand till firmly curded, then beat up with a
fork until the curd is finely divided; now strain and the
whey is ready for use; it should be sweetened a little; sugar
of milk, if pure, would be the best, otherwise white cane
sugar may be used. A newborn babe will require a tablespoonful
to begin with, every two hours, always slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
warmed. It is particularly essential to keep everything
clean, especially the tube and nipple; these are to be brushed
and cleaned after each meal, and then laid on a clean dry
plate for future use; the nursing bottle too must be rinsed
and drained. The prevalent custom of keeping the tube,
nipple and bottle in water after they are washed is a bad
one, for to have them sweet and pure they should be allowed
to dry out between times.</p>

<p>Condensed milk is often a valuable substitute for fresh
cow’s milk; its utility, is probably due to the employment
of heat in its manufacture, which destroys the germs or
spores that find their way into all milk, and to the scalding
of the casein which modifies its physical character so
that it no longer curds into large lumps when in the stomach,
but into smaller flakes. There are different brands in the
market, and even the best of them may be too old and shop
worn; they then become thick and dark in which condition
they are no longer fit for infants’ food. The Eagle and
Anglo-Swiss are among the best varieties; others contain
too much sugar, while some are adulterated with starch or
flour. A heaping teaspoonful of condensed milk to a teacupful
of warm water, previously boiled, is the average
strength, although better results are obtained when a thin
gruel of corn starch or arrowroot is employed instead of plain
water; when the child grows older cracked or rolled oats
or graham flour may be substituted for the arrowroot. The
gruel is prepared in the following manner: take half a teacupful
of oatmeal or graham flour, saturate first with cold
water, then stir slowly into three pints of boiling water; add
a pinch of salt and boil over a slow fire for three-quarters of
an hour, stirring constantly so that it will not scorch on the
bottom; then strain, and if it has boiled down to less than a
quart of gruel, add a sufficient quantity of boiling water
through the strainer to make it measure a quart.</p>

<p>The gruel is to be prepared fresh every morning, and the
above quantity will last about twenty-four hours. It should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
be kept in a porcelain or glass pitcher covered with a napkin,
and set aside in a clean cool place. At regular mealtimes
take out the required quantity, warm in a little agate
saucepan, kept only for this purpose, and when warmed add
the condensed milk, stirring until it is dissolved. This
makes a fine cream-like food, agreeable to take and very
nourishing if well borne by the stomach. The stools may
become too loose at times from the oat or wheaten gruel, then
this gruel should at once be changed for that of corn starch or
arrowroot until the bowels are regulated again, and when
that is done it may be advisable to return to the oatmeal
or cracked wheat. The exercise of a little judgment and
close observation in feeding a child will contribute greatly to
its well-being; any diarrhœa or disturbance of the digestion
must at once receive prompt attention and this can often be
accomplished by change of food; to allow these disorders to
run for any length of time is to invite serious consequences.</p>

<p>Adults or grown persons have also their share of stomach
troubles; as a rule they eat too much, too fast and do not
masticate their food sufficiently. It is not so much what a
person eats, but how he eats, not so much quality as quantity.</p>

<p>After an exclusive dietary of milk dyspeptics should
gradually return to a mixed diet, that is a regular dinner
once a day; but eat slowly and masticate thoroughly; thus
one eats rarely if ever too much. When the food is bolted,
it makes little or no impression on the nerves of taste, nor
does it appease the sense of hunger, and the only indication
of satiety is a feeling of fullness.</p>

<p>As to the time of taking one’s dinner that depends altogether
on the occupation and habits of the individual. In
dyspeptics in whom the digestion is slow and the circulation
sluggish the principal meal or dinner should be eaten at noon;
this gives opportunity to move about, stimulating the circulation,
hence increasing the absorption to its highest point. If
a man eats his dinner in the evening and afterwards goes out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
into society or attends amusements the late dinner is not
objectionable. But if a person is worn and tired out at supper
and then eats a hearty meal, and lounges around the
room the remainder of the evening, reading the newspaper
or otherwise inactive, he is quite likely to feel distress from
what he ate, and sure to experience occasional bilious spells;
nightmare disturbs his sleep and he awakes in the morning
unrefreshed, languid and dull. It is better for such persons
to eat their dinner at noon, and retire early on a very light
supper.</p>

<p>Beef tea became very popular at one time as a nourishment
for the sick, and there can be no doubt that many patients
who were stricken down with different acute diseases
slipped into their graves, because beef tea was relied upon
with a belief that it was a sufficient nourishment. Observation
and careful researches on the subject have proved conclusively
that the nutritive value of beef tea as ordinarily
prepared, that is chopped beef put into a bottle and boiled
in a water bath for three or four hours, has been greatly exaggerated.
The process of boiling the beef has no other effect
than that of drawing out the watery substance of the
meat. The phosphatic salts that are contained in the meat
are also extracted with the serum which holds them in solution.
The natural albuminoids (musculine) which constitute
the real nutritive element of beef are congealed and
surrounded by the fibrous tissue&mdash;that part which snarls
up and renders the beef gristly and tough. Yet as a nutritive
stimulant, beef tea possesses at times considerable value;
it is an excellent vehicle sometimes, for instance an egg
thoroughly beaten and added to a cupful of warm beef tea
is a desirable form of liquid food for invalids.</p>

<p>Eggs constitute a highly nitrogenized food and their
nutritive value is even greater than that of stall-fed beef.
The subjoined tables of chemical analysis give the definite
quantity of each constituent that is contained in one hundred
parts of egg and beef:</p>

<p>If we compare the analysis of egg with that of milk, a
remarkable similarity will be observed, save one exception,
namely the carbo-hydrate sugar of milk is lacking in egg,
and in order that eggs have the same property of nourishing
the body as milk, this element may be readily supplied by
eating a little bread. The writer is familiar with the history
of a case in which a patient was kept on an exclusively egg
diet for five months, and during this time he increased his
weight thirty-eight pounds; he consumed eight eggs and
twelve ounces of bread a day.</p>

<p>We hear considerable unfavorable comment in regard to
hard-boiled eggs, and indeed for good and sufficient reason,
but the indigestibility of the hard-boiled egg is not due to
any change in the nature of the albumen because it is boiled;
the cause is entirely mechanical. The reason is that a hard-boiled
egg is not sufficiently divided by the ordinary process
of mastication to allow the gastric juice to attack it from
all sides; if it were finely pulverized either by the teeth or
otherwise it would be as readily digested as a soft-boiled or
raw egg.</p>

<p>A raw fresh egg that is thoroughly beaten with an egg
beater is the most readily digested food that there is. The
author has known dyspeptics who could not digest any other
kind, and by adding a pinch of salt and half to one tablespoonful
of whisky after it is thoroughly beaten, it is certainly
one of the most valuable foods for a certain class of
stomach troubles that can be recommended. Patients whose
digestion is very weak should begin with one egg every four
hours until four eggs are taken during the day; when the
strength increases, two may be taken for breakfast, and one
for each meal the rest of the day; after the lapse of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
days another may be added to the second meal, and so the
number gradually increased until eight are consumed; prudence
would not go beyond this number lest an excess of
nitrogenous matter overtax the liver and kidneys to eliminate
it from the system and this result in other complications.</p>

<p>Dyspeptics, more than others, must avoid overtaxing
the digestive organs, and while the stomach is sensitive
and for a long time afterwards, they must avoid solid food.</p>

<p>The quantity of bread must also be jealously guarded;
while the stomach is very sensitive and weak it had better
be entirely suspended and when resumed no more than
three ounces should be eaten at each meal to begin with. For
those dyspeptics whose stomachs possess average digestive
power, and who require a nourishing and readily digestible
meal, the writer would recommend for breakfast a milk
gruel to which a raw egg has been added: he directs that
four tablespoonfuls of oatmeal mush be mixed with three-quarters
of a pint of warm milk and this worked through a
tin strainer by means of a potato masher; to the milk gruel
so obtained and again moderately warmed, a raw fresh egg
is added, which has been previously beaten to a foam, and
then the whole mess is again beaten together, seasoned with
salt and served in a bowl.</p>

<p>Medicines should play a very minor part in the treatment
of dyspepsia; the artificial pepsin preparations are all overrated
and their supposed efficacy is due to a careful and
regulated diet rather than to the virtue of the pepsin. If
the bowels are costive and if the stomach is sour and feels
oppressed, prescription No. <span class="smcap">II</span> will materially relieve these
symptoms.</p>

<p>A person who is suffering from indigestion must above
all things learn to discipline himself; when that has been
once accomplished the task of carrying out an appropriate
diet will become an easy one, and restoration to health and
strength will be the reward.</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
